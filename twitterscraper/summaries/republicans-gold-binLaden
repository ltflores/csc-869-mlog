@GeneTaylorUSA 2011-05-05 @OneLegSandpiper  I apologize for the "dumbest" crack. It contributes nothing to the dialog. Very inappropriate knee-jerk response. Sorry.
@GeneTaylorUSA 2011-05-05 @OneLegSandpiper  Congratulations. That's the DUMBEST thing I've read on Twitter in about a week.  Obviously, you're not an economist.
@GeneTaylorUSA 2011-05-05 @ib2smrt4u  Nah, we hate it when socialists (of any color) try to turn America into a European Social Democracy (which failed in Europe).
@GeneTaylorUSA 2011-05-05 @OneLegSandpiper  Sorry, until 1939 when lend-lease to Europe began. My typing sucks.
@GeneTaylorUSA 2011-05-05 @OneLegSandpiper  That's funny. The DOW had quadrupled by 1935, but economy didn't recover until 1935. Gambling doesn't create jobs.
