If #HCR was repealed, new plans would no longer be required to cover preventative services, like mammograms + flu shots, w/out cost sharing.
If #HCR was repealed, 326,000 in NJ would not know if they are receiving value for their health insurance premium dollars.
If #HCR was repealed, 166 NJ employers would not be receiving help from the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program.
If #HCR was repealed, insurance companies could cut off insurance due to a single mistake on an application-326,000 in NJ  would be at risk.
Please join us at 11am EST in the nationwide moment of silence to honor @Rep_Giffords, her staff and the other victims of this tragedy
103,905 people on Medicare in NJ would see significantly higher prescription drug costs if #HCR was repealed.

This Congress I am focused on job creation, our transportation systems, and livable communities. What issues are important to you?
If #HCR was repealed, Medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup. Nearly 1.3 m NJ seniors would have to pay extra to stay healthy
Repealing #HCR would mean  nearly 1.3 million NJ seniors who have Medicare would be forced to pay a copay for preventative services.
Just sworn in to the 112th Congress-- looking forward to serving the 13th District!

@DearCitizenTV Our country was founded on concept of common good -- i.e. helping our neighbors. Nobody made it in frontier by themselves.
.@runedart The venture capitalists can raise money but banks won't give loans without loan guarantees #askdems
.@nbonnem Republicans have their budget priorities backwards. Education is our future, not war. War research $$ are a waste #askdems
.@martian_mandi every industrialized country has figured out how to cover health needs for their people. We have no excuse. #askdems
.@mardod Start by nixing subsides for Big Oil and reinstating loan guarantees for alternative energy. #askdems
.@bettjay Absolutely. Like Willy Sutton said, I rob banks because that is where the money is. #askdems
.@drst like you, I'm fearful there won't be.
.@konquererz Has to be the bottomline - we can't backdown otherwise there is no future. Cutting safety net doesn't make us safer, save money
.@runedart only with tax reform aimed at the common good not the 1% at the top. #askdems
. @1SupremeGoddess  Lets start with defense spending. We spend more than the rest of the world on wasteful wars. #askdems

Are Rs happy w/ high unemployment?  Corp profits are up, easier to get scabs workers to cross line,  workers afraid to question bosses
look, Rs campaigned on "where's the jobs":.  Isn't it fair to ask them produce something, anything to produce jobs?

Gov Walker, WI, is a bully; MUST be stood up to. Not budget, but about collective bargaining. Don't back down men & women of labor.
42 years under Khadafy; now he is murdering his ppl whole sale.
@SaleemaGul, yes the House should condemn Khadafy's action.  Let's work on it.
Lybian military firing live rounds at protesters. Ppl not backing down. Khadafy revealed as truly brutal murderous.
@ungaro, right you are. Ppl need information to make good choices. So, let's keep up the fight for NPR and PBS.
@downwithtyranny, America needs progressive bloggers to remember the hopeful and patient are not suckers, weakings, or chumps.
@downwithtyranny, Ds passed sweeping Wall Street Reform, then election came. Cynical progressives checked out, independents believed hype.
@maysoonzayid, yes, I was disappointed.
W/ CR & Amend'ts, Rs want to reward dirty polluters by gutting EPA, right-wing media by gutting NPR, Wall Street Banksters by gutting CFPB.
Only "jobs bill" Rs introduce is Steve King's effort to gut Davis-Bacon, prevailing wage law.
In #CR, House GOP  slashes budget for agencies charged w/ policing Wall Street. GOP wld rather reward donors than help Americans.

@KID_A_KID_A, rather than cut responsiveness of govt, I prefer asking wealthy to pay fair share to nation which helped them get wealthy.
Important not to confuse cynicism w/ wisdom. Not 'smart', in-the-know or wise to declare everything/one is crooked, no-good, on the take.
@BinQuickBlog ,  Obama is on our side, Walker is not.  Walker is an avowed adversary of workers.   Make no false equivalency.
@TheBeadsman, labor is not corrupt, but what about corporate abuses? Goldman, Enron, WorldCom, Countrywide? BearStearns,Lehman, etc.?
@UnderempAmerica, progressives in congress have not ignored 99ers. Led by CPC members, we are orginal co-authors of 99ers bill.
