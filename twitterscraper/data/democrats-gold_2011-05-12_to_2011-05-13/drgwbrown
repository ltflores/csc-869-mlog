Friday, jean day, hat day, hopefully not storm drill day! (@ Hebron Elementary School) http://4sq.com/j2TJam
Going off line. Rest, well being, blessing, and new opportunities in the morning to all.
@kAtAstic10 Well my nephew did raid my closet to go to a Halloween party as a hippy! lol
@tcbird1 @Georg_Grey @mannyrflores Same to you. Great Friday to all. peace
@kAtAstic10 It is always very interesting when I find people inspecting my jacket pins or car stickers! No flags of any country, though. ;-)
@kAtAstic10 Hmm, which flag? ;-)
New song that will not leave my head is Sarah Hart's "Better than a Hallelujah."
@mike__friesen Pretty well for a crazy man! 10 school days left. Each day with kids examining what we want to know about life. It's good.
@tcbird1 Ours won't be in until during the summer.  Still hoping some of my "no way" kids proved people wrong!
@tragic_pizza Sorry to hear it. Although considering the physical place where you live, it might be odd to be in a good place?
@tcbird1 Now w all the stress this year, if somebody could remind teachers, we'd really be on to something! Lots of turmoil w10 days left.
