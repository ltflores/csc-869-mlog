@csyeung @volatile_tifa Yeah. I think I pissed him off when I said I needed to see pages in his portfolio, and clarified that I'm not German
Clippings I gathered (not my own art) to capture the tone of that new story and character I'm working on...  http://bit.ly/jVajWJ
@volatile_tifa @csyeung Run his rant through Google Translate, it's pretty clear-- but even more confusing!

Today has been straight-up terrible. Illness, blood drawn, stress at work, internet rants directed at me, all when I should be in bed.
