@brian4NY @Jencohn201 So wrong. Corzine & Dems could have extended it for a yr or made it permanent before I arrived & I couldn't change it.
@KevinEhret4NJ @julescator Wrong again. Tax surcharge expired on 12/31/09. Corzine was Gov & Dems in charge of Leg. 19 days till I took over
Question of the day: Do the Senate President and Assembly Speaker support gas tax increases or not?  NJers deserve an answer!
And Senate President Sweeney has been silent on the issue altogether.
Ystrdy, I called out the Legislative Dems on their plan to increase gas taxes & now Spkr Oliver refuses to state her position on the bills.
