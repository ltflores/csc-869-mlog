5sahandful did you see team oversights tough hearing getting to the bottom of sec myriad management failures 
wajobu i hope youll at least keep an eye on our work at americanjobcreatorscom help where you can ask tough s where you cant deal 
wajobu i see where youre coming from and understand your skepticism all i can do is share what were doing why and deliver results 
wajobu government does not do that today understand real impact of its actions back it up with facts and answer is this worth it 
wajobu and thats what we need to know which taxes which regulations then we use hard data to balance cost vs benefit 
wajobu which is sadly the hardworking smallbusiness men and women of america we must hear their challenges to fix whats unecessary 
wajobu can you at least give us the benefit of the doubt were trying to bring everyone into the conversation especially those not heard 
wajobu part of that problem is theres no way to listen to smallbusiness effectively thats where americanjobcreatorscom comes in 
wajobu some are from corporations many if not most are from smallbusiness that creates most jobs and opportunity in america 
wajobu fact is you cant tell me what regulations are necessary and what arent based on data can any one thats why we are asking 
wajobu how so all were asking is what regulations hold back job creators from one woman startups on up 
wajobu you arent addressing my pointdo you think what were doing makes sense 
wajobu but when govt regulates everything it regulates nothing effectively or efficiently see oilspill housing collapse 
wajobu i dont disagree with youteam oversight was on folks who let oilspill happen years ago same w fanniefreddies regulator 
wajobu govt doesnt understand its impact though on workersfamiliesbusinesses we must change that americanjobcreatorscom 
wajobu thats why we need your help at americanjobcreatorscom we need hard data on what regs help and hurt to target our work 
wajobu some regs are necessary some are not can you tell the difference
