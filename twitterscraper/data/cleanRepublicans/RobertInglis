right now were understandably focused on opposing i want to win the majority get to proposing some rs will find it hard to transition 
so if we take the majority wed better have some folks who have plans and who can warmly sell those plans by capturing hearts and minds 
while in the minority its largely about opposing the d agenda if we take the majority the job changes to proposing rather than opposing 
interesting conversation tonight with a tea party organizer we talked about how job description will change if the gop takes control

maybe then wed be willing to charge and fall on the hill making hard decisions to stop our nations bankruptcy just doing my job sir 
americas best are trained to be replaceable members of congress should see themselves as replaceable 
drawing inspiration from americas best in iraq and afghanistan try to compliment one of the and youll hear just doing my job sir

weve got to be bold weve got to say no to 150 million recreational lakes and weve got to be ready to explain entitlement reform 
solutions or scapegoats you get to choose today we can stop the spending with a bold plan like paul ryans roadmap for americas future 
read all about pork earmarks the union lake and fishing for votes httpwurlwsy6oq 
little pigs little pork little earmark for a recreational lake no go with one lady when you get to your credit limit stop the spending 
just left little pigs new location in greer union lake was main topic folks were fired upready to stop the spending 
also heard encouragement as to my voting record and discernment that we dont want to throw out those who have worked to balance the budget 
great doortodoor in augusta circle area just now found enthusiastic response and got out lots of signs stop the spending is the word 
everyone stop the spending 
really great doortodoor conversations in greer just now james grow the jobs mark find solutions bill secure the border 
very encouraging that people seem to be deciding to keep in office those who are prepared to stop the spending a voting record to prove it 
just finishing doortodoor in botany woods in greenville rain delayed the action for awhile but then some very encouraging conversations 
originally from ghana and living in nyc he joined the marines after 911 became us citizen after second deployment wow what an american 
as always happens at these events i wish that he had spoken an i had listened he was deployed 4 times to iraq lost his right eye in 4th 
spoke at two great memorial day events today after the event at greenville county square a former marine thanked me for speaking 
mr joe hudson died 3 years ago we were very close mrs hudson told me he went through a lot on memorial day remember joe hudson 
came home no hospital beds had to wait recovered somewhat worked steele heddle for a time never quite well married 64 years 
joe hudson went in normandy made it into countryside before being shot in chest and legs six ribs gone medics covered heart with skin 
just heard an inspiring account of love and devotion as i was going doortodoor off parkins mill road in greenville from mrs joe hudson 
sadly the other r and the d acknowledged that inaction takes us to greece we deserve better we deserve a congress ready to lead 
i asked if they the other r and the d were ready to cast votes and lead to solutions heck no came the answer wed lose our seats 
amazed by what another r a d told me in conversation on floor all agreed that people are mad all agreed that big decisions must be made 
its going to take more than 1200 to secure the border we should get on with it thats the first step in restoring the rule of law 
glad that pres obama will send 1200 troops to border we can thank arizona for restarting a push that should never have stopped 
to see some beautiful girls they got their moms looks and abilities on a tv commercial take a look at this httpwurlwsta0p 
health care reform should start with tort reform if youre not clear about that you shouldnt represent this district in washington 
meanwhile ive voted for caps support an even more sweeping proposal that i learned from srhs on my 75stop9 month health care tour 
ya think that lawyer cash might keep gowdy from answering the medical societys question about tort reform got the garbled answer on tape 
gowdy has raised 75000 from lawyers 19 of his campaign cash see httpwwwopensecretsorgracessectorsphpcycle2010idsc04 
ironic that just next door is the lawyers building which houses some trial lawyers lo and behold theres a gowdy sign out front 
just met in front of greenville county medical society with physicians who heard trey gowdys nonanswer on tort reform last tuesday night 
and the chances of me being for a 150 million earmark for a recreational lake zero 
not my style to build false hope better to be straight up and tell folks the truth union lake can only be built with an earmark 
i admit to not fitting in w washingtonstyle politics build false hope in a competitive grant process for a public private partnership 
no i researched the proposed lake w the corps of engineers and they told me bluntly we will build the lake only if forced by an earmark 
if it were simply a publicprivate partnership seeking a competitive grant for a 5700 acre recreational lake why would i have opposed it 
its time to take a look at all that trial lawyer money treys gotten its time to ask why those trial lawyers are investing so heavily 
gowdy didnt get away with the nonanswer on tort reform tonight the doctors were onto him they heard a nonanswer talked to me about it 
amazing that trey just had another chance to turn his tort reform lecture into a position but he didnt
