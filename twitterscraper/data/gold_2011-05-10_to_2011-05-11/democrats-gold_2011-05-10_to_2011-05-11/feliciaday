@wilw You stupid man. Now
I'm Addicted to Dungeon Raid too :(
Haha! RT: @paulandstorm: [S] Wow; you really do have a thing for Clippy. #apologiestojefflewis http://t.co/pQPPnzs
@paulandstorm I'm gonna write a Clippy Defense song. Reggae-style, because he had to Retire to Jamaica in shame :(
@paulandstorm what's with all the Clippy hate? Dude can't catch a break.

@AyeAye_Capn It's true, every time I tweet I get 100 corrections. But then I get 1000 nice tweets so it balances out :)
@lordcheeto I KNOW!  I'm never reading people who correct me again!  Well, not really.
@amyokuda WOOT WOOT!
Yes, I am. 66.667 OK PEOPLE IF YOU WANNA GET IN MY GRILL! :P  RT: @gregharbin Oh, shit. You're getting so many corrections now, aren't you?
Day 10 of Guild shooting pretty much owned. 5 more days to finish!  That's the 2/3 mark!  66.666 percent done!  #mathmajor
I'll make a bold statement and say that the problem on the Guild set today has never happened on a production before. The BTS will be epic.
@bergopolis I LIKE THIS ANSWER! :D
@bergopolis What is the answer to my question?
@dcsmith1 Mums the word!
