Ugh. That feeling I had last week is back-- Pressure in my neck/head, tired, dizzy, hot.
@jurithedreamer I think "lighter than air" would be beautiful done by you- but first there's Kiki, and I know you prefer dark/creepy stories
@jurithedreamer Me too! You should draw everything I write! ;)
@FlozaxRollins Totally understandable. Unfortunately, I'm a self-publisher, so my stuff is basically all creator-owned.
RT @mangastudio: Back by Popular Demand - Manga Studio 4 EX for only $99 until May 15th.  http://bit.ly/k7Wf7v
@FlozaxRollins I'd feel weird approaching a stranger about a project like this (i.e. no budget). heh
@FlozaxRollins Oh, her work is lovely-- Some of it comes fairly close to the idea in my head, too. Do you know her?
RT @TheJohnBarber: I wish the iPhone had an indicator of how good your reception is. It could be in the upper left, where the "random bullshit" display is now.
@coasterchild Sounds good!
@matthewdowsmith @onegemini I gather that a lot of photographers use them-- mostly for events, sports, weddings, etc.

I could imagine @csyeung @saulone or @jurithedreamer drawing this new character (or @Orgueil painting her) but they have other things to do.
(RTs of that last one would certainly be welcome. This character is like a beautiful song stuck in my head, and I can't play the flute.)
Call for Artists for a new character that I can't get out of my head... http://ian-x.deviantart.com/journal/40507275/
The more I get to know this new character, to more I realize how hard it will be to get @McKelvie or Manara to draw her. Hrm.
