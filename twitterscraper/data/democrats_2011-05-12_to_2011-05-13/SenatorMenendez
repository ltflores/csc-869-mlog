@jjamberger -Taking away $2 B in subsidies from 5 companies earning over $125 billion per year wont raise prices, but will lower the deficit
A Republican Senator jokes gas prices are so high rats are carpooling into NY. New Jerseyans don't think $4 gas or oil subsidies are funny.
With Big Oil’s record profits, the last thing they need is billions in taxpayer handouts. Getting ready to talk with @AliVelshi on @cnnAM
