Hey @ryanhastman! Peter Lougheed is attacking Alberta and destroying jobs! http://t.co/PCvHdZt #yegfed via @djclimenhaga
@Tony_Tracy @canadianglen have to do it all. folks who are trained/mentored will be bolstered if their arguments mirrored in press.
@Tony_Tracy we shouldn't rely on them, but don't discount the impact of a newspaper on the views on the shop floor.
@canadianglen @tony_tracy the online media referred to is a start, but I think it's time to go big media.
@Tony_Tracy Hugely agreed. Remember when there were labour reporters? It's frightening to think of how much ground we've lost.
@Tony_Tracy great perspective, with the deck stacked against us, worker to worker story telling will win the day.
@Tony_Tracy but I wonder how many releases about progressive policy debates or bargaining victories would be ignored anyways?
@Tony_Tracy yep. those are definitely important. do we have good demographics on readership for those?
@Tony_Tracy at this point even softened views with the occaisional labour focus much appreciated over massage smears and horse races.
@Tony_Tracy print is a dying breed, but still important. The right took a loss on the national post, maybe it's worth it.
@Tony_Tracy I like the online presence of those - but it's time to go big. Would like to see serious talk of left ownership of print media.
@Tony_Tracy agreed. Better online presence is needed, but so is a better presence in the mailboxes, tv sets, and of course, shop floors.
@Tony_Tracy I hope CLC isn't looking at social media as some sort of magic bullet. Any talk of labour buying it's own media?
@ChrisLaBossiere Uh. Klein "best for the province for the 90s"? And you want us to think of #abparty as moderate?
