RT @wilw: Well, I guess I'm done using TwitPic and will download and delete whatever I have there. Bummer. I liked TwitPic. http://is.gd/wtjBle

@NASAJuno can you use Flickr instead of TwitPic? It will be easier for people to find, tag, comment, favorite & share your great photos!
@jessykate i agree w/ your comment! http://is.gd/qOFFQ4 i was recently told i was less successful b/c i hadn't sold a startup cc/ @mike_ftw
NASA's Juno Mission site is pretty lovely - like having a Discovery/Science Channel show in your browser: http://missionjuno.swri.edu
Omg, a NASA site (about a Jupiter mission) that uses an Underworld track for the intro: http://missionjuno.swri.edu <3 (thx @setiinstitute)
@blaine @BenWard indeed it was - it'd be lovely to have a quality service integrated into the official Twitter apps as a choice.
@mattb sweetie, you're ruining our TwitPic debate! ;)
@blaine @BenWard @blech @tomtaylor well, here's a damn good reason for users to not choose TwitPic: http://is.gd/ETHzM8
@BenWard @blech ok, revision: just get Flickr to do all that stuff, then people won't use ugly ad-saturated crap! then again, Facebook.
@blech if you get Flickr directly built into Twitter's app functionality/preferences, then people won't use twitpic anymore! cc/ @benward
@RellyAB and definitely go to the basement if you're hearing sirens! Take a radio/tv with you if possible, keep the weather news on
@RellyAB as someone with lots of tornado experience - go to a basement
