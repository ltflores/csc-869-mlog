Surely Senate Democrats won’t shut down the federal government over 1/1000 of the budget. Do they really believe Washington wastes no money?

We cut bloated federal spending and gave our economy more of what it needs to bounce back -- and less of what it doesn't.
The healthy debate that's been missing for the last four years yielded results for the American people.
It is just a down payment towards getting our government back to fiscal health, but early this morning House Republicans kept their pledge.
We conservatives have been fighting a long time to see this week.  http://online.wsj.com/article/potomac_watch.html
This would have NEVER happened under the past Democrat tight-fisted control.  Messy? Yes. A bit chaotic? Sure. Exhilarating? Absolutely.
We are debating and voting – day and night – ways to shrink the government, cut waste,  eliminate obsolete and ridiculous spending.
This is a great week! The shackles are off – the “People’s House” feels like it finally belongs to the people.

First 17 days in the mine were the worst, but God gave them hope. Among the first items sent down was a tiny bible for each of them. Wow.
