@climatebrad Yeh, they gave Obama a Nobel prize too. I will take a look at the paper you sent. Have enjoyed the exchange.
@greenman3610 @jimmiebjr calling names and using generalities to dismiss specific arguments seems to be standard procedure for know-it-alls
@climatebrad Climate always changing. Cycles, like those on sun. Co2 tiny factor now used as excuse for research grants & power grab.
@climatebrad  Even though emissions way up in 60s& 70s scientists were recording a global cooling & predicting catastrophic ice age.
@climatebrad The insistence by scientific community on cooling in mid-1970s reflects same attitude, a disservice to science then&now.
@climatebrad Baseline doesn't impact on rate of change? You claim its "rapid." Start calculation at 1900 is it the same rate of increase?
@CAconservative1 Too many caucuses. Let's see what they do to deserve my commitment of time and energy.
@climatebrad  Didn't 70s egghead consensus warn of cooling? Is warming baseline end of mini-ice age, low point in a 500 year temp decline?
@climatebrad  Second straight failure cements my lack of faith in putting all our eggs in NASA basket.  Call me a skeptic(but not a denier)
I strongly agree RT @presjpolk: We've got to stop the Patent Reform Act. Reps should be fighting it, not rolling over. http://t.co/SXbKNUI
@trscoop Reasonable pay and benefits for public employees= no one at risk. Bankrupting compensation demands= everybody at risk.
@climatebrad Thanks, good discussion. Experts on both sides of your claims&claims often change,like expected ocean raise, like warm winter
@climatebrad pollutant=harmful to humans. CO2=no harm to people& small impact of temp. Solar impact huge. Current cycle temps not alarming
@climatebrad Man made pollution real, its just not changing the climate. CO2 non-pollutant, no threat to human health, spurs food production
@climatebrad Yes, CO2 is less than one half of one tenth of one percent of atmosphere and more than 80 percent of that is from nature.
@climatebrad Have spent considerable effort to get NASA& others to focus on Space debris rather than Global Warming.
@climatebrad @WarpedNine Great, call names rather than answer specific arguments. Prominent scientists on both sides Global warming debate.
@UCSUSA Everyone who disagrees is using talking points? The tactics used by  Global warming advocates to silence disagreement is shameful
@climatebrad When they claim human activity is causing asteroids to threaten the earth and I'll question that too.
@itcaughtmyeye Last year's predictions 100 percent wrong. Why trust them for 25 years out. In 1970s consensus was global cooling.
@itcaughtmyeye Prediction from same guys who warned of dry and warm winter, got their PhDs in exaggeration and stiffling open discussion
@itcaughtmyeye Yes frequent flier miles won't be canceled,  the price of fuel, buying car & parking won't shoot up& backyard BBQs are safe
@ronrowan1 I went through a couple of unemployed life segments. It is never fun.The secret stay active. Volunteer and you'll meet folks.
@Ryanexpress77 That is the way it should be, but for the Dems the rules don't count. Lib judges consider themselves royal law makers.
@ronrowan1 The next series of elections will bring fresh opportunities. Find a candidate you like , volunteer, and it may lead to a job.
@ThatGirlCA What you are really talking about is abortion, ending the life of a yet to be born baby. Otherwise, PP would have funding.
@UCSUSA U ignore issue: incredible coincidence or solar? Whose head in sand? Read e-mails, U trust your source. Warming has become change
@UCSUSA your answer deceptive: talks Mars warming. Issue is Earth and Mars icecaps shrinking at same time. Coincidence or Solar impact?
@UCSUSA Guess ancient climate cycles, like current one on Mars,which mirrors changes on earth, not product of sun but of human activity,
@Song1964 Gay groups chase evangelicals away. So what? People have a right to have organizations that reflect their values.
@Song1964 @ThatGirlCA  To Planned parenthood taking life of yet to be born(abortion) more important than all other services combined. Hmm
@Song1964 Family reunification can take place in another country so obviously family reunification is less important than immigration to USA
@USCIS_Sloth OK
@conservcompend Thanks for the thanks. I'm sure we'll find ourselves on the same side of most issues. As for the others OPEN YOUR EYES,haha
@conservcompend you are clearly focused on theory. Open your eyes. Should we have forced IBM not to provide cutting edge tech to Hitler? yes
@conservcompend To sell in China it has had to be manufactured in China=value added wealth only flows to China.
@ThompsonAnthony One or two simple amendments would correct short commings. Not permitting vote to amend bill is not acceptable
@conservcompend open your eyes. Letting Chinese dictators  make the rules has empowered & enriched them at the expense of  American people
I'll be on House Floor in 7 minutes talking about why I'm opposing the #PatriotAct Extension - http://cs.pn/fNFPPz
@conservcompend Free trade works between free people, otherwise manipulated by fascist government for its benefit.
@conservcompend Unequal rules = unequal results = unacceptable wealth transfer.

@KeepitMadeinUSA right thing to do. No thanks necessary. DANA

@catawu your name calling reflects arrogance and ignorance that does not deserve a reply. And this is my last reply.
@granpaowndog I speak and act directly. There is no reason for US to push for a choice that will leave anti-freedom radicals in charge.
@TurboKitty  I support a free election to determine Egypt's next leaders. Why install a new gov before it is elected?
@granpaowndog A September election= time for moderates to organize. Radicals now ready . Demand to install new leaders now is stupid.
@catawu Not silly. U ignore a huge factor that lowers the income of the American people:million of illegals bidding down wages. You care?
@ErinDavern Ollie is right! Liberals loudly support democracy movements that would topple friendly govs, unlike when enemies are vulnerable
Those demanding Mubarak go right now, rather than after a free election later this year are putting us at risk. #Egypt
@catawu You believe illegals are not bidding down wages? That health,education&criminal justice systems not heavily impacted?You don't care?
Mubarak outlined a workable plan for a new team, of the Egyptian people's choice, to take over democratically. We should support this.
@50plusoutofwork. So many wonderful people suffer as a result of 2 decades of their own government's bad policies. Got set things straight.
@catawu Americans(including the people of my area)=every race. Your approach=racial analysis and name calling. Who is the racist here?
.@catawu Racist=someone who,because, of their race, can't admit horrible impact tens of millions of illegals have on Americans of all races.
@catawu Illegal immigrants=domestic outsourcing. Sending jobs overseas=hiring cheaper illegal foreigners here. The American people lose.
@CatrachoNews The way to stand with the people is to ensure there is an honest election rather than letting a tough clique takeover.
Mubarak should declare he nor his son will run in next year's election & pledge it will be free & honest, thus time for non-radicals. #Egypt
@USCIS_Sloth We try our best to help constituents. There is the flood of illegals into our country makes immigration harder to deal with.
@pparkersv I have always given GW Bush his share of the blame. Can you say the same about Obama?
Surfers say NO FEAR,  Obama has NO SHAME.  Rather than clarify, his #SOTU speech blurred issues. #SOTUresponse
@Ryanexpress77 Absolutley right!!!
@Ryanexpress77 You are absolutely right. Current policy is insane.
@gumbii3 "full of it" & "bigot" That's how some people argue their case, but you can do better than that.  Make a point don't call names
@Ryanexpress77  The sooner the better. Obama will veto it and the American people will better understand he is not on their side.
If you include illegals it will soon be 100 million without hope because it will attract more and break what is left of our economy.

@DawnRayner Member's health insurance same as every fed employee and majority of working Americans. Did Obama give it to you free?
@SUPnazi760 China's regime has made suckers out of our well meaning,warm and fuzzy leaders. America now pays the price or such none sense.
@mikeytheshow Bush and Obama are not gangsters or Nazis. The same can not be said of China's President and his henchmen.
@themrsdad Thanks, feel free to pass your assessment on to as many as you can.
@mikeytheshow That someone heads a regime that is the worlds worst human rights abuser, the organized murder of religious followers.
@Song1964 Can't always say what people want to hear, but I try to engage rather than pontificate. Stay cool. DANA

@Song1964 The immigration laws apply to you.There are many people who wait their turn or move overseas to be with their loved one.
@Song1964 You just might have to move there instead of having her come here.
@Song1964 Every citizen can run for Congress and whoever wins has right to speak to Congress...a good way of deciding who has that right.
@Song1964 Not saying leave. Saying set your priorities. Illegals already flooding in so opening the legal door wider will not happen.

@Song1964 Sometimes love means choosing to live with one's loved one in another country.
@SUPnazi Yep!!!
@Song1964 People can be reunited here or there. It doesn't always have to be here, especially if those involved knew the complications.
@Ryanexpress77 We'll find out!!
