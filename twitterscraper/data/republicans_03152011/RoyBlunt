Sorry to hear about the passing of Mike Murphy. A one-of-a-kind voice for KC radio, he will be missed.
The status quo is not a solution. Americans sent a clear message last fall & we must listen by reining in out-of-control spending.
Once again we’re at an impasse thanks to the White House & Senate Democrats’ unwillingness to support substantive budget cuts.
Very sad to hear that David Broder passed away today. David was a greatly respected journalist & I always enjoyed our conversations. #wapo

I intro'd an amendment today to ensure airports can use private screeners. Congress intended this opt-out would be open to all airports.
Health care repeal vote could reach Senate floor as early as next week. Americans rightly expect an up or down vote.
Thinking about everyone in Missouri today. Bracing for the worst, hoping for the best. Monitoring weather developments. Stay safe everyone.
I look forward to voting to repeal this bill on the Senate floor as soon as possible
Today's ruling in Florida marked the second federal judge to agree with Missourians and deem the individual mandate unconstitutional.
