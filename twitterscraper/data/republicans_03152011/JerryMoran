I remain committed to leading with #KSCommonSense and to making tough choices so our children & grandchildren can dream big & pursue them.
I came to DC because we are to be stewards of what we’re given & to pass on to the next generation the life we love & lead #maidenspeech
We have before us today an opportunity to set the games of politics aside and work together to confront the enormous challenges before us.
Lastly, we need to repeal the flawed #hcr & replace it w/ commonsense changes that reduce costs, & promote choice in our health care system
To meet our nation’s energy needs we must develop traditional sources; encourage development of renewable energy; & encourage conservation
For the U.S. to remain competitive in a global market, Congress must also develop a comprehensive energy policy #maidenspeech
History shows that econ. growth starts w/ the private sector. DC must create an environment where entrepreneurship & businesses can flourish
This is a challenge we can't ignore. We must pursue reform but this will take the leadership of Pres Obama & the willingness of both parties
In addition to living by a budget, we must also address our long-term unfunded liabilities, such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare
The best way to get our spending under control is to actually set a budget and stick to it #maidenspeech
Congress can and should do what Kansans do every day: make decisions based on solid values and real accountability #maidenspeech
Truth is out-of-control borrowing & spending has real consequences on our lives: inflation, high interest, less growth/jobs #maidenspeech
Not a revenue problem, it's a spending problem. Experience shows that more money raised by DC results in more spending in DC #maidenspeech
Our gov borrows 40 cents of every $ it spends and half our debt is held by foreigners, many who do not share our interests. #maidenspeech
"We’ve come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. We must act now to protect future generations."Reagan. I issue the same warning
In KS we work hard, come together to find commonsense solutions & try to make a difference in our communities, state & nation #maidenspeech
My parents worked hard, avoided debt, paid their bills & wanted to make sure my sister & I were able to pursue our dreams #maidenspeech
Humbled to follow in footsteps of @govsambrownback & Sen. Dole. I'm privileged to serve w/ @senpatroberts #maidenspeech http://ow.ly/4bDnF
My hometown is down the road from SenDole’s. Plainville, a special place where folks know their neighbors & look after them #maidenspeech
