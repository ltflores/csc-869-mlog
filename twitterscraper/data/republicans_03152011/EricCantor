Called @GovWalker to offer support for his efforts in Wisconsin, while we are cutting spending in DC.  #TCOT
Today is the first big step towards getting our nation's fiscal house in order - $100 billion in spending cuts.
This debate will be an open process.  Every member will have an opportunity to submit his or her vision of how we can reduce the deficit.
I believe in free markets and in the ability for small businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs.  #tcot
RT @johnboehner: The American people want us to cut spending, which will help create a better environment for job creation in America
These cuts are not easy - but we are finally doing what every American has to do - begin a path to living within our means.
We will use every tool at our disposal to boost America's long-term economic confidence - it begins by cutting over $100b in spending
Had a fairly robust conversation with @BarackObama that we are serious about cutting spending, so that economy will grow #TCOT
