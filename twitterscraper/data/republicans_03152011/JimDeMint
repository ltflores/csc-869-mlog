It's not about who NPR/PBS hires or fires. It's about taxpayer funding: We can't afford it and they don't need it.
GOP fights to save U.S. from bankruptcy, Dems fight for cowboy poetry http://politi.co/eeGCLZ
NPR, PBS lobbying campaign called into question http://bit.ly/gMbCiU

Working with Sen. Enzi to repeal ban on incandescent light bulbs. DC's nanny-state mentality is out of control http://bit.ly/dYL4eQ
2 years after stimulus bill passed, we see it’s a tranquilizer for jobs & growth. Unemployment in Jan '09? 7.6%. Jan '11? 9.0%
Revenge of Democrat appropriators. Hundreds of lobbyists recruited to fight GOP spending cuts http://abcn.ws/ijaNAy
All Republican Senators have now joined to cosponsor the bill to repeal ObamaCare, S.192
Our debt crisis demands spending cuts, not a freeze. When a car speeds toward a cliff, you hit the brakes, not cruise control.
GOP must fight the debt, demand passage of Balanced Budget Amendment http://politi.co/hN4uFX
Proud to join with Reps. Jordan, Garrett to offer $2.5 trillion in spending cuts http://bit.ly/i8UC5P

Taking a time out from politics to thank God for His Son; his gift of love, mercy and salvation.  Merry Christmas everyone.  Gal 5:1
Unelected, unaccountable Democrat FCC commissioners are taking over the Internet. I'll work to keep it free & reverse this decision in 2011.
Passing a major arms agreement in lame duck is outrageous.  Dems trying to jam through a liberal agenda before conservatives come to town.
Keep the pressure up! Reid still trying to ram through flawed START Treaty, DREAM Act amnesty, & DADT repeal.
And most of all thanks to all of you who spoke up, called your senator and demanded an end to reckless big spending Washington!
Thanks to the Republican appropriators who stood up against this pork-filled omnibus bill.
Too embarrassed to read their own spending bill, Dems have agreed to a short-term CR, funding government at current levels without earmarks.
Reid finally admitted he didn't have the votes to pass it and is withdrawing Dem pork-filled omnibus.
Unprecedented: Congress has never passed major arms treaty in lame duck http://bit.ly/hNIZrv
10 New GOP Senators have asked Reid to wait on START Treaty until they take office in January http://bit.ly/ezo9OG
START Treaty could seriously limit our missile defenses that protect U.S. and our allies http://bit.ly/hQNKKV
No surprise that Democrats still don’t like bills read in public before Congress passes them.
According to @Senate_RPC, omnibus spending bill contains over $1 billion to implement the unconstitutional Obamacare law
Dems want to ram through the 1,924 page spending bill before Christmas, but I'll join w/ other GOP to make them read it on the Senate floor.
Ignoring the Nov. elections, Democrats just introduced a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill stuffed with thousands of earmarks.
I will continue to fight to fully repeal the unconstitutional Obamacare and pass real solutions to make health care more affordable.
Ruling against Obamacare's centerpiece, the individual mandate, should mark beginning of the end for the health care takeover.
