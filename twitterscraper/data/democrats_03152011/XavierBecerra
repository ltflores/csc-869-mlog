So every $1B we invest to build a school/road/hospital puts 28,000 of us back to work. When we build, we work!
@GovernorOMalley is right. There should be no higher priority for this Congress than creating jobs now.
Job one is Jobs! More than 1.3 million private sector jobs were created last year but our work is far from done.
