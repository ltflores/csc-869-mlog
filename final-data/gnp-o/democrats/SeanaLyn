@ZachRetox either way he's an idiot and should've died so the rest of us don't have to deal with his stupidity.
A teenager jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge for "fun" & lived. http://bit.ly/e3XvUz Wish he had died, idiots like that dont deserve 2 live.
@heidikies @zachretox *sniffle* I guess I understand.... That just means we will have to party extra hard at the cabin!

@heidikies @ZachRetox but that means you'll be out of town for MY birthday :(
@ZachRetox the best part was she looked at me looking for validation....I just frowned.
@ZachRetox I was in Burlington Coat Factory earlier and a tween got way too excited over Ed Hardy heels. I almost punched her.

Watching Final Destination 2....the opening car crash scene from this movie still makes me freaked out when I drive lol.

@missbethsf high five!
@WiFi_Pirate @variandavid great minds think alike!
@VarianDavid dammit you know whats funny...I initially put Rogue then changed it to Phoenix at the last second. Curse my second guessing!
@VarianDavid because he doesnt have tits. Or at least he doesnt have soft girly tits like Phoenix.
@DoctorSheriff while she was taking a nap I took the opportunity to surf the net...she woke up and busted me. Damn that Business Cat!!!
@ninjaharlot omg I completely lost it at the Alan Linkenbean part.
While I know the whole Charlie Sheen thing is played out (man that was fast!) the SNL Charlie Sheen bit is hilarious http://bit.ly/hZbDsy
Oh no! Business Cat caught me looking at Facebook on company time! Not looking forward to our 1 on 1 meeting later http://twitpic.com/47wzoj
@vyshalee @CesarQuintero no she loves it! (yes I put my female cat in a tie). She just wants me to pay attention to her and not my laptop.

@ITrogletI loooool confidence is one thing. Approaching a woman on the street and asking to hook up is another...unless shes a prostitute.
@DoctorSheriff nope. But Im just glad I got a good man on lock down and dont have to deal with guys like that on a regular basis lol.
I should preface that last tweet by saying he 1st asked what I was up 2 & when I said "goin back to work" he said "ur not a wage slave r u?"
A guy just walked up to me on the street and asked if he could have my number so we could hook up later. Wtf?! Soooo glad I'm not single!
