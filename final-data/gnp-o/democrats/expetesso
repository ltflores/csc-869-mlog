Planning a trip to Guatemala for next winter; we'll be headed to Antigua on Corrin's spring break. Now to convince her. http://j.mp/geNrrd
Have sketched out my double-sided business cards: one part cancer.org, one part http://www.expetesso.com. Now to find a printing service.

Working for @americancancer, I've always called myself (and been called) a Change Agent. I think my new title should be Chief Detective.
A physican I've never seen billed an insurance company I'm no longer covered by for treatment I never received. WHAT? #ShadyBusinessIsShady
@JMHaughey Yikes, thanks!
@JMHaughey Am planning on it for my lunch break. :)
@JMHaughey I'm not really sure yet -- just thinking it through. Shall ping you later with some thoughts, super-fundraising champ!
@JMHaughey Are you up for working on a @crowdrise project for Japan? I'd like to put a project together for the Red Cross.
NY Times reports that helicopters first picked up radioactivity 60 miles offshore; BBC recency = widening influence. http://j.mp/ibI0Il
US aircraft carrier detected low-level radiation 100 miles offshore from Daiichi, amidst another meltdown alarm. http://bbc.in/fRFiR8
@katefais How did I only just today find your knitting and baking blog?!?
My anniversary is at two o'clock this afternoon. I would say "how like a mathematician," except that 3.14 1:59 was my idea, not hers.

I'm an NP Tech Professional. Is it terrible that I would rather go to Book Blogger Con or the World Health Summit than #SxSW?
Texas certainly knows how to do breakfast, and a solo meal preceding 15 hours of teamwork should keep me sane. :)
Waking up at 4:36 without an alarm is pleasant, but odd. #TimeZones #FreakMeOut

Not to self: you are never "hungry" by Texas standards. (I was just given a turkey-and-avocado wrap the size of my head!)
@improperlybusy Happy Birthday! Hope it's terrific.
3 days of sunny and 75 degrees? Looks like I'm packing light!
@megabus Thanks for the response. That makes me sad. Any plans for inter-regional connections?
Traveling to #Austin tomorrow without my laptop. I'm looking forward to 8 hours of flight time with knitting, my iPod, and Thursday Next.
Just registered for @relayforlife of Green Island, NY; will be partying with Corrin & our friends upstate come June! http://j.mp/aVib94
@megabus How would one book travel between and through your hubs to get from New York City to Chicago?
That said, I should have worn real gloves rather than fingerless knitted ones. #StillBloodyCold
The trees in my park have little hints of buds! I won't be surprised to see pale, new green when I come home Saturday. #spring #almosthere

Root vegetable soup seasoned with Cavender's and sweet Spanish paprika is simmering on the stove. Yum! #bake #BecauseCookIsntOneOfMyTags
@MindyKB I'm so sorry. :(
@booksquare Makes me terribly glad I didn't buy into the eBook hype, and even more glad that I use -- and give money to -- libraries
@MindyKB Is your apartment too cool?  Try putting the dough on the stove and turning the oven on to 200 degrees for an hour.
Spring edition of @vogueknitting in my mailbox. The "citrus brights and coral spice" have me dreaming of summer and steel drum bands! #knit
Wearing a backpack full of yarn & carrying 2 tote bags, 1 full of books, 1 full of (clean, empty) baking dishes. "read knit bake" indeed!
@ajafair Whee! You're much more impactful than I, but I imagine you're feeling what I did when my #StoryOfStuff review got to Google Page 1.
Curious: do you use #Groupon to test potential new favorites as the ads suggest? I can't see the offers as anything but one-time cheapies.
@katefais Was it lost?
From a social perspective, expiring medical patents = good for patients. From a continuing research one, it's disastrous. http://j.mp/dPCYl8
Am disenchanted with "big corporate" philanthropy & disease prevention atm. Reading about friends in the Peace Corps with wanderlust.
It's been a decade since I last played, but I'd love to pick it up again. Eight lessons should get me back in shape... #MyPreviousTweet
Super sad that it's Monday, but relishing the musical memory of Saturday night. Just sent off an inquiry for #Saxophone lessons this summer.
Have lived between two apartments for the last almost-year w/o losing anything vital. Until now; keys are at Corrin's. #CountDownToMovingDay

@Zero Well, I still don't *like* games, but I get the value for my company. :)

@megabus Binghamton!
@Zero the surface to air missiles in Libya were Cold War remnants, yes?
@zero I need to sign up for and get situated with #SecondLife tonight. Any tips?
@SeanMMcNally Yeah, I understand about 0% of that.
@Zero @pastorbecca And, frankly, even tougher to want to.
@SeanMMcNally Fill me in when you figure it out; had many arguments about such when I lived in Beantown.
@Zero for the latter, talk to @pastorbecca. She's had a few run-ins and been much more civil than I!
@Zero just saw that; wonder how much the Wisconsin governor's words/actions/attitude toward protesters played into the ruling.
On the first leg of a 2 train + bus + car trip to Binghamton for a meeting with Second Life fundraising cancer activists. #MyJob #ILoveIt
TED is far more engaging, enlightening, empowering, and entertaining than anything on cable - thus no TV for me.  http://www.ted.com/talks
@improperlybusy I bet you don't realize how often that happens, or how many hearts you break when they realize you're passing. #centercontra
@MindyKB Yes, I use mine with PhraseExpress to create custom keyboard shortcuts. And to bring up the start menu.
@Zero @gilanac I agree. As poetry, "Imagine" beautifully underscores that the verb is most important. Set to music, not so much.
Subway screamers aren't offensive for what they say, but for how they convey the message. #evangelists #IHateThem #NotJustReligiousOnes
@Zero the GSA charter restricts scouts from accepting donations for anything other than work. Selling is work, delivering is not.
Acquired the perfect Anniversary present. Even if I accomplish nothing else today, I feel like a queen.
