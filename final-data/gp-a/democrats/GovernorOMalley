Retweet this if you are mad that Congressional Republicans are allowing their hate of gvpt to hurt families #governmentshutdown
If the tea-partying Republican Congress thinks a #governmentshutdown is good for a nation's economic health they should go visit Somalia
Thanks for your leadership on this RT @WhipHoyer Dems are working hard to avoid #shutdown so fed employees are not furloughed
MD is home to thousands of fed employees who will go w/out pay b/c Republicans have chosen to wage an ideological war #governmentshutdown
it appears that Congressional Republicans care more about hurting our gvpt than they do about economic recovery #governmentshutdown
Congressional Republicans are allowing their hate of gvpt to hurt hardworking families--this is unacceptable #governmentshutdown
