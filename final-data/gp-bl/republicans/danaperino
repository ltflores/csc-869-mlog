@BillHemmer reporting live from GZ, I'll be on with Alyson at 10:40 am ET.
@KevinMaddenDC was it a cigarette butt? I see that all the time. WHY isn't a cigarette butt considered litter by some?
@apifeni it was a wonderful night - smiling still this morning as mentees learned a lot and mentors got some "women" time. Thank you!
Good news about admin moving Colombia free trade agreement forward...it's about time, but now is better than never.
@SchwabbieMan yes, it's like a penny for your thoughts. Um, people don't even pick up pennies off the street anymore.
I just could not afford to buy gold yet. I need another 48 hours of "how would you milk this" q's before I invest.
If I had $1 for every crass, ridiculous q from media this week, could take you all to lobsterfest & baconalia & have $ leftover for suits.
60 Mins promoting exclusive with Pres Sunday. Mistakenly thought it was a part of the series given this year's appearances. Should be good.
RT @StewSays: RT @JohnCornyn    My op-ed on Jack McConnell's nomination to federal bench http://fb.me/10XRHZfa7
@jonkarl I guess that's like the definition of pornography.
@DustinkBailey thanks for watching the weekly segment with me and Varney - we won't be on tonight but will be next Tuesday! @laurenfritts
Trip to nyc canceled for today - can't wait to see #HenryVizsla!
@donsspencer hear hear! I'm for privatizing. Then maybe you could get a diet coke instead of pepsi...amongst other benefits and efficiencies
The Acela? Again? I will quote you and say I won't dignify that with a response. #HenryVizsla http://yfrog.com/h6h5dorj
Oh Acela, I've missed you. Got ready for the ride today by finishing this little # last night. http://yfrog.com/h380jykj
Worth a look, if you have some time - US int'l broadcasting compilation of news of OBL's demise. http://1.usa.gov/kSoELT
Was under the weather last night, but awoke to post this on Nat'l Review re: OBL, http://bit.ly/lsTBl6
@TonyFratto oh yes, and when I asked his buddy why he wanted to become a navy seal he said, "Chicks dig it."
