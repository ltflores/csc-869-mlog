Word is the speaker has a Saturday graduation to be at so tomorrow will be a short day in the House. #ksleg
RT @rjwilson: An official prediction in the front of room is that this round of conference will not occur. Who gets 2 carry that message ...
@suziegilbert that's because the real party is in these committee meetings
@MightyQuinn72 I won't be done here till at least then anyway
Another round of budget conference committee. @rjwilson is already here saving front seats for the show. No cotton candy though. #ksleg
No agreements made this time around. Education committee will meet again Monday. #ksleg
The live music is for national prayer day. We're in the room next door. Lots of guitar. #ksleg
The house sent SB 111 to approps and SB 21 to Edu budget. Aurand trying to get them back in this committee #ksleg
Hensley said there was no hearing on the bill Aurand wants. That's why there won't be action taken. Says we need a public hearing #ksleg
Aurand wants to hold the answer hostage until he gets an answer. Schodorf says we need to do this & support schools not play games. #ksleg
Vratil hoping the house has a response to offer on HB 2015. Aurand says he checked w/ the speaker. Schodorf says shoot straight here. #ksleg
Discussion on placing contents of SB 111 into SB 21 and doing a coference committee report, if sent back to this committee. #ksleg
Live music in the education conference committee. Seriously. #ksleg
@arturbulent hopefully that doesn't come back up.
@MightyQuinn72 or you can bring me one if you wanted.
@MightyQuinn72 it's a gas station I think. Wait till I'm out of session and I'll go with.
@crowjennifer earlier Brady sat between Reardon and I, he says this is my payback.
Sitting between Bills in the Education conference committee. Reardon & Brady. I'm in good company while we wait on the conferrees. #ksleg
@arturbulent not yet. Pay runs out on 5/11... Some say then, some say next Friday, some say after. The halls talk a lot.
Edu conference committee will meet upon adjournment tonight in 159 S #ksleg
Siegfried motions to accede on SB 21 & SB 111 and place in conference committees. #ksleg
Motion to adopt the conference committee report on SB 193 passes 107 to 10. #ksleg
House is suspending the rules to consider a few bills. Carlson motions to adopt the conference committee report on SB 193 #ksleg
Word is tomorrow there won't be much going on at #ksleg. That's what the halls tell me at least.
House goes back at 3:30-ish, Edu conference committee at 4 (or adjournment of the House), Budget conference committee at 5. Then beer.
