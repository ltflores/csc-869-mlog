Also, Twitter still will not load for me to save my life today, so if you're talking that way, I can't hear you. :(
I am finally in hotel (7 flights of stairs up, yipes!) at hour 24 of travel.  Only slept around 2 hrs, got sick on plane. Shoot me now.
...and with that, Herpes & I are about to board the plane ride from hell.  You will hear from us in around 11 hours. If we live that long.

Herpes & I are having some technical difficulties, but we are @ SFO.
....and away I go!
@ciaomichaella I could, but Herpes and my uterus have never traveled together before, and I'd rather not introduce them. :P
Torn between bringing plushie Herpes or my (knitted) uterus for photoblogging fun. Both get around on their own already, but hmm.
