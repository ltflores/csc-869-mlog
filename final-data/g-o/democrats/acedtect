@Travenscroft Nah, we left. Sorry we missed you!
@mstcambot thanks. We worked hard on trying to get that right.
I stalk you back @ekai  @ Old Pecan Street Cafe II http://instagr.am/p/CL-l2/
@georgenewell I did thanks to @OMG_chad

@PhatEmoKid @DinoKadich Hoe?  I'm a gardening tool?
@chub06 I haven't used hotmail in years so it's not a comparison, but I'm satisfied with Gmail. I also use Yahoo and some private services.
@carlryds @vdivincenti Ah-ha.  So you have to add support for it in your app. It should just be on by default and you take action to block.
Chrome survives pwn2own, but why? AOL lays off 900, outsources jobs FROM India, WiFi aircraft interference overhyped http://live.twit.tv/
@AzyxA yes
@vdivincenti presumably yes. If you're using the twit app on an iPad or iPHone, definitely.
Dear devs, one of the worst things you can do in designing your app is assume I have only one email address. Love, Tom.

@ucfgeek Sadly no.  No time.
@mikelerch @iyaz @bworley It does NOT mean no more Worley but there's only so much Worley to go around.
@JonStrickland It's OK. This is one 'the man' couldn't stop you from talking about. YOu have to take those chances when you can.
I kid because I love. In all seriousness very happy to have @iyaz joining the team starting at the end of March. More details leaking later.
Hey @jonstrickland I add my congrats to @iyaz on his new... What?!!  Wait , WHo... He's going to .... I go to Florida for one stinking day..

Orlando seems to be just like Vegas but with a global replace of babies for drunks and ice cream for booze.

@georgenewell Whew.  Glad I got that one right!
@georgenewell Because... not everybody who gets an iPad owns an iPhone?
@The_T @extralife the question is how does it stay true to it's name with all those people.
@extralife thanks!... Wait... Who am I in this scenario? Doesn't matter I'll take Odin's speed.

@sflsocialgeeks thanks so much. Afraid my schedule is too tight but appreciate the invite.
@seanreiser it does. Except at the end.
@iians I should add that I enjoyed it too. Not raving, but liked.
Adjustment Bureau is not a must see buy it was a nice tight package of intrigue. A little light in the end.
Off to see Adjustment Bureau and find out just how loosely it's based on PK Dick's short story.
@julianrdetris @joshlawrence @veronica you know one of the producers (@eileentv)
@MikeCoogan That looks fantastic.  Now I want pizza for lunch.
@MikeCoogan Where is that!?!  I want to eat that.
@MikeCoogan he he. As long as I don't miss the ides of March.

@dantz I should have added "to me" you're right.
@Aeltaarion The electrical system has the same issue and yet we almost never have to 'throttle' high users. Rolling brownouts maybe...
@Aeltaarion The issue is more complex than I implied but there is a false premise.  Everyone will not be downloading at full potential.
@JohnAnealio Thanks for making robot songs!
@julianrdetris Yep that was me, with @joshlawrence next to me. @Veronica is in that same show.
@dantz can't we both be right?  Perfect for you, useless for me.  We're just different.
@dbrodbeck what a coincidence. So did I.
@mattwarren Thanks man!  A little daunting to think about the show in a full-on "screening room" lol
@TSSaloic Sadly it is not.  21+ It's a bar.  But we'll be out and about with the liveview in all-ages land.

MBP data transfer from Time Machine went smooth, but it's the first time an ethernet transfer wouldn't work.  Most won't have time machine.
@kevinchen I would if the new MBP ever stops canceling the migration.
