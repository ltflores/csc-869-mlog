@rje7 yep here all tomorrow, fly out monday morning. you around tomorrow day? going to any sessions?
@rje7 hey Ricky! uh...none? that's the extroverted slash exhausted from book tour part. :) would happily socialize in my hotel lobby lol
@themayorpete I would totally be social if there were somewhere slightly more low key than all the raging parties to do it :)
@dewalt or just a way to interact with them not at raging parties :)
@dokh there's Come Out and Play in NYC and SF now annually :)
the main thing I learn each year at #SXSW is how introverted I am ^_^ wish there were a street game festival as part of SXSW!
@JohnComes if you find it, let me know! I want to see it too :)
@areyouthatguy gothic lolita, although I added a white t underneath so as not to be too shocking ^_^ tomorrow, airport chic! ^_^

Should land in Austin in 2 hours even if I have to give my #sxsw talk tomorrow in a goth corsetted pink taffeta party dress :-)
It is kinda fun,  I feel like a character in a movie who escaped or needs a quick disguise & does a cheap makeover in a convenient store :-)
Game continues! Connecting flight was delayed so I made it! Also bought toiletries, tank top and military pants at Houston airport
Last update does awhile : airline says 50/50 chance I will make my connection. Cross fingers.  If I fail, will regroup in Houston :-)
@ivanovitch following!
On the bright side: I have my wallet, laptop, phone, iPod, chargers, boots, and lipstick. Need: clothes, contact lenses, toiletries.
RT @thulcandrian: @avantgame This is becoming a social game. Time to source some friends to extract you.
RT @keithdok: @avantgame Time to reload your save and try it from a levels back.
@atlasimpure thank you, filed a report.
Haha wait it gets better other flights to Austin from Houston are sold out :-) so I would have to drive myself and I don't drive
@cloister that made me laugh, thank you. Xo
RT @cloister: @avantgame Did you set this game to expert? It sounds really difficult.
Because life is awesome now my flight is delayed to Houston, will now miss connecting flight & likely be stranded overnight in Houston haha
@fyietc that is so kind. I will ping u if it turns up. Thank u so much.
At Boston airport now landing in Austin 10 pm tonight too late to go shopping. Still dressed like a slayer bride from #pax omg too absurd :)
RT @DrSbaitso: @avantgame Treat it like an adventure game: Pick up everything not nailed down. If it is nailed down, find a crowbar.
#pax keynote was so fun but now i am stranded without stuff! I guess this is a game? Survive #sxsw with nothing but the shirt on ur back? :(
Nothing to wear. Help friends at #sxsw can I borrow something :( sad face just lost so much clothes and gear :( super sad face
