Looooooong day! (@ Hebron Elementary School) http://4sq.com/exzDgo
Whole week studying, movie, all day field trip, assignments; a couple months pass; no idea who IN state hero in Revolutionary War was. sigh
@missional I agree with you, we must.
@squintinginfog Thank you very much, I enjoy your contributions as well!
@n8wide @orpheus42 and in the order and beauty of it all, plus in the mystic darkness, I experience God. We each have our own path.
@orpheus42 @n8wide As for believing in an Xian God, there are so many definitions of what it means: have to let individual speak for self.
@orpheus42 @n8wide Borg helped me with answers nobody in my background would give on how the canon even came to be Power+Usage,
Time for bed. One more week, then its Spring Break. Have to get bisy on writing my book chapter. Be at peace, Bring Peace, Be peace. Shalom.
@n8wide Will have to check these out. Borg and Brueggemann make a lot of sense to me as I examine the insane ways we have used this unbook.
@Aidanmom03 @DianeRavitch Very true! Disrespect to teachers is still rooted in the thinking of dominating males. Want us at those $ levels.
Rest in the eternal trip Owsley!
@DianeRavitch Remember when the press actually investigated and reported on issues instead of giving sound bites from paid mouth pieces?
My hope for continuing to serve children comes from One who proclaimed that they are the true citizens of the Kingdom.
@orpheus42 Well said.
Insiders have known for some time that "school reform" really means "school labeling" to justify "school elimination." Career end to say it
@tragic_pizza Thanks!
@DianeRavitch Also eliminates unions who can afford ads to counter corporate ads promoting puppet officials in elections.
@Aidanmom03 @DianeRavitch Eliminate us and the union pay scale for new teachers, never pay a living wage again.
@DianeRavitch I used to run a life changing public school for expelled kids, now retirement from public ed is looking like a real choice.
How does an organization that puts services to needy children first on their list of cuts, get to be called ProLife?
RT @SPerkinsCenter: RT @MissionYear: If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other. -Mother Teresa
How can US condemn use of force and political imprisonment when we have never renounced our own use of them? #freeleonardpeltier
@Di65 I believe the Jesus who cried, "Why have you forsaken me?" knows, cares, can & will. Prayers for your relief.
What if the only thing holding our mess together is the lack of anyone able to project a truly alternative vision? #GOPDEMTEAGARBAGE
88,000 unaccounted for!?
@JeffersonObama @orpheus42 Oh Dear Lord
@tragic_pizza Is your sermon posted?
Japan quake altered Earth's rotation for the day! Nuke expert says keep adding cool sea water, where is warm water going?
Excited to preach the crucifixion this year. When the dark is this deep, we need the God who traveled death's road before us.
News from Japan makes politics seem trivial for the moment, but both sides admit people's futures are at stake. God save us from us.
I don't remember anybody, GOP or otherwise, saying public unions were destroying US after police and fire fighters rushed into 911 towers.
@FakeRepublicanP @roy1956 power seeks power, $ more $, and domination seeks destruction. Too true.
@Roy1956 Thanks, now to figure out what the menu is!
@Roy1956 Within the next year, the church in Haiti will probably ordain me to serve here. & I'm an old Tolstoy fan.
Time to get up outta this chair and work on fixing some dinner.
@Roy1956 Meanwhile, I consider myself a missionary to the US from a Kingdom without borders (or from my friends in Haiti).
@Roy1956 If my wife was ready, I would be in Haiti or Africa. Would rather help those trying to build a life, than watch ours crumble.
We're going to set up a no fly zone in Libya, right after Gadhafi finishes blowing up all those fighting for freedom.
@BridalAnointing Unbelievable, still no contact with Son-in-law's family in southern Japan since the quake.
@Roy1956 Have to give props to state legislators in WI and IN refusing to participate though!
@Roy1956 Add in the Dem's claiming to stand with people until it hurts their contributors, Tea Party full of nuts, and we are on our own.
@Roy1956 Good people tried appeasement before in history. Empire always wants more. Without unions, Corporations can buy any election.
Just finished grading big stack of papers, finishing grades for report cards. Honor Roll 4 those who work hard, reckoning day for slackers!
@Roy1956 Wisconsin has enough tax breaks for the wealthy to balance everything he is cutting from working people + environs risk=bad faith!

@mike__friesen Brings me to my knees.
@mike__friesen I agree. Then when they come home, we ignore their needs demeaning ourselves & our society further. Pitiful.
@mike__friesen Too sad for words, and what happens to all the loyal & patriotic young men and women we send to kill others?
@n8wide No problem, it is so sad to watch rights of workers and care for those in need stripped in the name of debt caused by war.
@mike__friesen I like that, we cannot afford it in terms of our lives, ethics, or claims to follow Jesus either.
@n8wide I mean the deficits they are using now as excuse for cuts are the result of the wars we are already in. More = even worse.
Read my lips: What our country cannot afford is war!

@dtatusko Look at their stuff a lot for news of events affecting global friends.
@dtatusko What about Reuters or BBC? Any better than ours?
@dtatusko It is amazing that people believe they are watching "news." ABC had spokesman for nuke energy telling whether there is a problem.
Which is > irritating; news channels doing talking head opinion shows, or "news" reports and questions from reporters w no expertise?
