All Whitman's answers focused on poll-ID'ed scapegoats--public emps, immigrants, legislators, career politicians, & vampires.
Only paid staffers and family members like legislators. That shd kick her relationship w/the legislature off to a good start!
Whitman believes the water bond had "all the elements"--neglects to mention the element of huge taxpayer subsidies for private water users.
Brown's best line: Inexperienced people with spines of steel get flummoxed by the shark infested waters of Sacramento.
#cagov-Poor Whitman, facing off against those organized middle-class working folks who dedicate their lives to public service.
@cagov-Whitman says Brown beholden to pub emp unions; by her logic, she's beholden to Wall Street plutocrats. Whom do voters trust more?
#cagov-Jerry Brown has hit his stride! Go Jerry!
