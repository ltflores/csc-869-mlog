"Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal." -- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
May we realize Dr. King's dream in which the content of our character, and nothing more, defines who we are as a people.
Today we honor the life & memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man whose moral courage & inspiring words influenced & changed a nation.
I will be a guest on @KARNNewsRadio 102.9 FM at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.
