@Sanuk_D I was exaggerating a tired old argument. Sorry if I offended you.
You started it. ;) RT @michaelfmuller: .@Sanuk_D @timothypeck @JayneQPublic Alright y'all. Leave me alone.
Why is this do hard for people to comprehend? I am an UNaffiliated thinking libertarian. Not a Republican. Sheesh.
Soon learned that the GOP only pays lip service to my values. Changed my party affiliation to UNaffiliated. Dumped them.
Clarification: I started blogging as a political neophyte. I was a Republican. Wanted to show people what Republicans OUGHT to be.

@michaelfmuller Who in the GOP responded?
@brainshrub @michaelfmuller Wait a minute. Minorities don't have ID? Historically, ok. But now?
@Sanuk_D What are you referring to?
@michaelfmuller You're such a provocateur. Never mind. No ID's for anything. Least of all voting. Vote Early, Vote Often!
@michaelfmuller Here we go. Po' people don't have IDs. What a bunch of BS. Don't po' folks need IDs to collect welfare?

RT @michaelfmuller: .@brainshrub Who are the disenfranchised? Don't they have ID?
@michaelfmuller I think it is asinine. Engraved invitation to voter fraud. I'd love to hear a cogent argument for the current policy.
I will NOT hold my nose to vote for anyone today. Only voting for candidates I fully support.  GOP hacks need not apply.
GOP will claim credit for electoral victories. Truth is, voters are voting against Democrats, not FOR Republicans.
