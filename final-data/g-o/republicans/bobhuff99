Steinberg speech 12/1/08: what do we want people to say 10 yrs from now? ...that we delivered budgets on time...  OOPS!
Steinberg made motion to bring 2 bills from approps to floor. When I did same 2 mos ago, was told "that's not how we do it in the Senate."
Payback. Steinberg calls on Dem colleagues to layoff Fuentes bill, AB2216. Steinberg bill just died in Assembly approps which Fuentes chairs
