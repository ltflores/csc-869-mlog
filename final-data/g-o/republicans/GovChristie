@DomStampone If I had caved 2 the pressure & signed a blank ck, Gateway tunnel never happens. It was standing up for principles & winning.
@DomStampone $1.6b per yr over next 5 yrs in state resources alone. 100% fed match 4 $16b over 5 yrs. What are you talking about Dom? Crazy!
@DomStampone No mention of entitlements at all & he is dealing with the big issues? I guess we just have a different opinion on big issues.
@DomStampone If I heard any meaningful commitment 2 deal with big issues, then maybe I would be more confident. Not a word in SOTU. Bad news
@LizziLitt thx 4 following me
@DomStampone My point: hi-speed rail is fine but not until we deal w/$1.5T deficit, $14.5T in debt & entitlement explosion. Big things first
@LoriKillion Pay cap went into effect for all NJ school superintendents due to the efforts of my administration.

Here’s my take on The Gateway Project  http://bit.ly/fEsNtx
ICYMI – check out clips from my discussion w/CEO’s and business leaders on creating jobs in #NJ http://bit.ly/f2fSVA
Business leaders feel that they are now part of the dialogue when it comes to New Jersey’s growth
(cont.) #NJ needs to focus more on strategic investments in higher ed and do more to encourage graduates to stay in state
For a long time relocation experts would not look at NJ - but the BAC & outreach from @LtGovGuadagno is starting to turn that around
We have to do a better job of making our tax structure more competitive #NJ
For many CEO’s, frustrations like taxes, regulations and cost of living are masking New Jersey’s assets
Great panel discussion today with business leaders and CEO’s in NJ. Some of the themes of today’s meeting…(cont)
Today's roundtable will focus on challenges & opportunities for biz attraction & expansion, job creation & econ development
Holding a discussion w/ more than 20 CEOs and biz leaders today in Newark. Panel will be moderated by @YWCavuto
@jDOTmenz Just not true. Sorry u had a bad experience but don't paint with such a broad brush. Not fair to all the good employees.
@stopthefreezeNJ don't like the stats, u change the game & call names. embarrassed 4 u. wasting time on NJEA games. Keep supporting failure.
@stopthefreezeNJ  4th & 8th grade & HS charter students outperform their dist counterparts in math. Facts r facts. Time 2 go back 2 work now
@stopthefreezeNJ Of course not, you elitist. Why would u care about changing a failed system for 104,000 students in NJ? Keep up the failure
@stopthefreezeNJ All the data is publicly available. Another red herring to distract from the failed policies of the NJEA.
@jDOTmenz Not nice or true. I do not like folks losing their jobs & we have so many great MVC employees working hard every day.
@RobUsdin Never said they were end all be all-just a block in foundation of reform. And, btw, your income taxes go 2 failing districts daily
@JoshuaHenne again not listening. Not surprised u don't see connection b/t reformed Ed system & jobs. Also not confident u speak 4 biz in NJ
@stopthefreezeNJ No you dont--just protection of the failed system of yesterday which has led to decline of America's academic achievement.
@stopthefreezeNJ against u and your dinosaur arguments? You bet!
@JoshuaHenne Today's announcements at Revel create thousands of jobs NOW. Sorry to disappoint your negative, partisan little heart.
@stopthefreezeNJ $17,620 per pupil, per yr--MOST in America. Underfunded? U do live in your own, self-interested world. $ does not = quality
@stopthefreezeNJ Go to the Robert Treat Academy & look in the eyes of those kids & their families. 70% of charter HS outperform District HS!
@RobUsdin Have proposed a bill to expand oversight, pending in legislature.
@RobUsdin NP having your income tax $$ fund failing districts though, huh? Your Rx: Stay the course. Support the union. Continue the failure
