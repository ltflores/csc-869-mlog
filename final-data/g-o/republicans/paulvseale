@eyokley although you must defeat @johncombest first round. Will be interesting. :) | back to the real tournament and analysis.
@eyokley interestingly enough, that would put you above @DLoesch, although I think she has the easier bracket. We will see.
@eyokley @FiredUpCommish Definitely agree with the 1 seeds.
@DLoesch you were placed as a 12 seed, deserved higher! RT @eyokley http://bit.ly/eXIUwV
@eyokley Loesch a 12 seed? Come on!
@eyokley so who got "snubbed." There has to be tournament snubs!
@Lscranton correct. looking forward to your reporting later on tonight on player reax, etc. Thank you as always.
@Lscranton I know a lot of us are hoping and praying he stays. Today cant feel good. Would be even worse if GA Tech or Mizzou snags Zo.
@Lscranton something i would like to see written about after all is said and done: does being snubbed increase the likelihood of zo leaving.
@moelane sad thing is that I looked up to Peggy growing up.
again? sigh RT @Lscranton Murray St. not much size. 3 guard lineup. I would imagine defending dribble penetration will be key for #MSUBears

@Lscranton I wonder aloud what would happen if we play Alford here, or even against Cleveland State.
Agreed RT @DBear5 Going to say one thing about the College hoops selection process: Thank goodness it isn't like college football.

RT @AllenVaughan: #MSUBears snubbed from espn's most snubbed list. Haha
RT @Lscranton: It's official. Missouri St. will not go to NCAAs. #MSUBears will play in NIT, as a likely 1 or 2 seed.
Posted on local fan board: the NCAA Tournament goes from 34 to 37 at large bids and mid majors get only 1 additional bid.
So should #msubears . Guess we are just used to having the same numbers but getting snubed RT @seanhackbarth: Jay Bilas is making the case..

@Lscranton probably a good idea. let them know we are still proud of them. Thank you for the coverage (of course more to come).
@Lscranton how are the guys holding up?
Dear CBS, bringing up Colorado as a school that missed the tournament is not a plus. Enough abou BSC schools. They got 30 teams in. geeze.
RT @springfieldNL: #MSUBears won't  be dancing in NCAA, headed to NIT http://bit.ly/gIUpzy
@Lscranton Thank you for correcting. Was watching the screen on CBS and didnt see harvard or Cleve St.
@Lscranton correct me if i am wrong. Lowest RPI to be left home. Again. Please confirm.
Agreed RT @Lscranton Southern Cal and its RPI of 80 is in. Don't agree, but not surprised.
You cannot argue numbers this year. With UAB and VCU getting in this year, the Bears met the criteria. @Lscranton @AllenVaughan
Dont forget CUSA got two in as well. RT @Lscranton Colonial now the 'glory' mid-major league
Wow. Dagger.  Still, not over. RT @Lscranton USC/VCU the other play-in 12 vs. 12 game.
boss button for NCAA tournament on demand viewer is tons better than in the past.
@Lscranton ah, my bad. Thanks for clarification. I agree.
@Lscranton I would hope they all get in.. but Georgia? Clemson?
@Lscranton So you think St. Mary's and the Bears have no chance?
@Lscranton @AllenVaughan Georgia getting in as a 10 seed hurts, I think.
@Lscranton @AllenVaughan The big question here is whether CUSA counts more than the MVC. UAB lost in the tournament quarters.
RT @Lscranton: RT @AllenVaughan: Uab? Does MSU have a chance?  - Profiles are almost identical.
UAB gets in. Fascinating.
@Lscranton www.cbssports.com ftw. :)

+10 to CBS for bringing Sir Charles onto the selection show.
Lets hope hes wrong about a lot RT @Lscranton Duke a 1 seed. Lunardi was wrong about that.
