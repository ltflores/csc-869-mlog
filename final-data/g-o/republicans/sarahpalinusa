Is MSM just awestruck? Is that explanation for ignoring his claims? MT@dcexaminer: WH claims fail/Hugh Hewitt           http://bit.ly/dERcdS
Pres is mistaken. Again. Claims we control 2% world's oil & he "boosts production"?Who advises him?Who writes his stuff?Why won't press ask?
Mr.Pres: "increase oil" means unlock land; end de facto moratorium; hire agency heads who ALLOW production (not just verbally "encourage"it)
Prayers for Japan in these turbulent times. May recovery be swift and complete after this earthquake and tsunami.
Mr.Pres: pls don't tell us tomorrow we'll rely on OPEC to make up oil shortfalls;we're blessed w/rich US sources.Long term solution? Tap 'em
