BHO's propagandistic SOTU made Chávez proud. Misreps, feeble tales and outright lies.
Maybe BHO, maybe. But Hu Jintao and his pianist took it to you.
BHO did not get the memo. High speed train to rural Alabama isn't my concern, even if it "lowers the deficit". Whoa... that makes no sense.
Yawn... flat and uninspiring. The *magic* is gone.
@NicoleBelle Racism..? I suggest you look up definition of the word.
Nappy reading scripture just seems ...odd. Could they not get a preacher?
Tuned in to watch AZ Memorial. All I see is BS political theater full of weirdness.
Sheriff Dope-nik went a bridge too far and defecated on himself http://bit.ly/gfDnlo
@Hluska "intellectual lightweights" huh? Your linkage of AZ tragedy to Palin is obtuse, hence "the libtards"
@Washpostmodern @tacomamama The Communist Manifesto calls for kind of Utopia that can only be brought about by violence and conflict.
Favorite book of AZ shooter Jared Lee Loughner is "The Communist Manifesto" (see profile) http://bit.ly/egw1RL
Libtards blaming @SarahPalinUSA campaign graphic for AZ shooting. Their logic is overwhelming.
Anyone using AZ tragedy as an indictment of any political group or ideology is an asshole.
Thank you "basketball"
".. due to recent legislative changes .." my health insurance just went up 9.7% Thank you Barack Obama.

@savethiscountry Cool. Thanks for the link.

@savethiscountry I knew better too, that's what makes it painful. Oh well, lesson learned.
@Newfederalists it's THE ripoff. And all under "it's in 3pt extra special ultra fine print in your contract".

The larger political message of BHOs #hcr proposal is that he has no interest in compromise or listening to GOP http://bit.ly/aU9kod
Use your head @ScottBrownMA. If 2/3 of unstimulating stimulus remains unspent, why 15Bil jobs bill? See where I'm going with this?
Other than @ScottBrownMA's vote, four other Senate GOP "yes" were from the usual suspects http://bit.ly/aauUS0 #RinosAbound
Yo @ScottBrownMA what's up with "independent voice"? Not that I'm surprised. Always knew you were a lying RINO #ForPresidentMyAss

@davidahilljr You the 'voted for' people got punked. And you know it too.
Ok BHO, let me be perfectly clear "lower our debt" from the guy who doubled it... well... sounds retarded #sotu
RT @baratunde: Obama says we'll double our exports. Someone remind him all America makes is youtube cat videos #SOTU
@davidahilljr no, only 1/2 of one.
No BHO, they're not standing still nor are they engaged in sabotage and self-destruction #sotu
@davidahilljr Look, we can beat it to death, but there is a 'standard'. Follow it or suffer serious consequences. It is what it is.
@davidahilljr But you're not an elected official, neither am I. Thats the difference. Big time.
@davidahilljr Nice. Lets have the Prez curse like a sailor during State of the Union "..our shit is stong bia'tches..' You lost you mind?
@davidahilljr You don't think that any of it, all of it, is an acceptable behavior from the elected official, do you?
@davidahilljr Ahh... search YouTube, there is plenty of indisputable evidence there ('bitch','k-street',' STFU','kill you', etc)
@davidahilljr Yeah, but it doesn't take away from the fact that he is NUTS. Nothing can.
@davidahilljr Fiasco? ...tell me more about this mythical creature.

Seriously folks with 68% in and 7 points for Brown... It's clear! #MAsen
Hay @maddow, why the droopy face?
@davidahilljr Lma0z!
@davidahilljr True story... it actually happened when I was 4 and my folks got it on cam.
If #MAsen isn't your ass is grass and WE ARE the mower, I don't know what is. Heck yah!
About 40 in... 6 point spread remains. My leg tingles.

@davidahilljr Re: #hcr savings // Kinda but in combination with catastrophic coverage & high deductable. Total out of pocket is very low.
@davidahilljr Yeah, another propoganda. Statisticaly speaking, bankruptcy IS NOT the reason to takover 1/6 of econ or mess #hcr for the rest
@davidahilljr Just google it. But the jist is tax advntage + roll over of what's not spent.
@davidahilljr Damn, was talking to myself // In other words don't fix what ain't broken or grow something that already is.
@tannerk In other words don't fix what ain't broken or grow something that alredy is.
