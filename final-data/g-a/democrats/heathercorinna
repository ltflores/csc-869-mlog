Oh yeah: carmelized onions are so getting added to this.  Haven't worked my kitchen for a few days: think I was getting DTs.
going to finish work so I can relax & cook. Thinking three grains w/spiced garbanzos, spinach & a balsamic/pomegranate glazed faux chicken.

@GalFawkes It makes me cringe, too, so my best answer is to refer those folks out, but I'm curious how other providers/educators deal.
Anyone ever get asked abt STIs from someone who thinks they may've contracted 1 while exploiting/abusing someone? If so, how do you respond?
@evolvingwife I did from the start, so maybe I just need to remember my role hasn't changed, even though some of my relatives have.
@ProjectSAFE Thanks for such a lovely mention of Scarleteen! :)
@tastytrixie (And honestly, I could use some of that mojo myself these days.  It's so not just you.)
@tastytrixie For serious. I have a bday coming up, and there's no door fee on bdays.  Holler if you might have time. Would love 2 go w/you.

@montagueblue Nice!
@SCPOC I am in the perhaps enviable (albeit sad) position of owing most of my relatives far less than nothing, to say the least.
@SCPOC It's work-stuff these two family members lose it with, so if they're going to be shits, would rather just make'em go away, period.
@tiaramerchgirl The turned tide in our family, at least, is that this time around my mother would support me in telling them to STFU.
I have this awful feeling unfriending relatives is going to create the same drama telling them to sod off when I left home 25 years ago did.
@ScottMadin That was more for me than you.
@ScottMadin I will not make arsenic jokes.  I will not make arsenic jokes.  I will not make arsenic jokes. I will not make arsenic jokes.
RT @mikkipedia: @heathercorinna They are private donations. Called taxes.
@LiteratePervert If this conversation keeps up, I should easily be able to drink enough for the both of us.
My tea-party uncle now suggesting women's healthcare should be 100% funded by private donations.  WTF is IN that tea, anyway?
@LiteratePervert We may need to organize an online wake (with booze, please) for family members we've all lost to political alzheimers.
@LiteratePervert There needs to be shorthand for the reaction I had reading that. It's like OMG, only I got speechless halfway thru the O.
@LiteratePervert Yeah, again, limited sympathy here, since I've got a uterus for them to put in the pile going under their boots.
@LiteratePervert I'd feel more sad abt the fear driving them there if I were less angry abt the control over others they're trying to gain.
Have resisted urge 2 tell bio-fam members they friended me, I only said OK to most to be nice & am not all that committed to being nice.
@ScottMadin Big boo.  Seriously.  I remember him as such a gentle, peaceful guy growing up.
is super-sad that one of my fave uncles as a child has fallen under the thrall of another who has become a tea-party asshat.
@tmrobertca There was also a time when I could still read if I put contacts in! Alas, that time is in the past. :(

@musingvirtual Big time.
I want to live in a world where I do not have to finish annual taxes right before my birthday every year. Because wah. :(
Just puts a big smile on my chest.  Pretty rad to still feel that way about a job you've been doing for many years.
I often tell young people who thank me 4 helping I'm glad to have been of help to them: it's always so cool how deeply I feel that gladness.
Some kids start their Saturdays watching cartoons. We've started ours by watching zombies.
To offline life I go!  (No, really this time!)
@tastytrixie You know you always have an open invite to come hang with me, lady! Xoxo. Or, maybe we need to arrange an Olympus trip soon?
RT @jaclynf: Oh, so that cramping I've been feeling is my uterus being thrown under the bus? That explains a lot.  #ncmr11
And I'm off for the night and tomorrow, which will include a trip to our lovely farmer's market & a visit from friends including my fave ex.
@mopheadf I also don't get the sense, honestly, that right now is all that different from then, in a LOT of ways & the worst ones, sadly.
@mopheadf The 50s -- like most other times in history -- were not as monolithic in that regard as they often get presented since.
is sad to accept my beloved Mystic Heather will just NOT stick around in my hair for more than a week, despite bearing my namesake.  Pity.
One of the best parts of my job is how often I get to help people who are scared feel less fearful; uncomfortable people more comfortable.

Realizing I can't recall the last time I took time off that wasn't one sick day, heading out shortly to plant bulbs in the (yay!) sunshine.
@sciville Cheers!  So flattered.  I think you're pretty awesome yourself. :)
@ClinicEscort  I love you so. :)
I was just the first follower for @oboshealth.  I feel like such a cool kid, getting in the door first. :)
