@OneLegSandpiper  I apologize for the "dumbest" crack. It contributes nothing to the dialog. Very inappropriate knee-jerk response. Sorry.
@OneLegSandpiper  Congratulations. That's the DUMBEST thing I've read on Twitter in about a week.  Obviously, you're not an economist.
@ib2smrt4u  Nah, we hate it when socialists (of any color) try to turn America into a European Social Democracy (which failed in Europe).
@OneLegSandpiper  Sorry, until 1939 when lend-lease to Europe began. My typing sucks.
@OneLegSandpiper  That's funny. The DOW had quadrupled by 1935, but economy didn't recover until 1935. Gambling doesn't create jobs.
@hora_del_cafe  He's scary to lots of people. But David has access to a mic and says what many are thinking.
@GeneTaylorUSA  Typo:  business confidence, not investor business.
@OneLegSandpiper  NOBODY said that. They said it was part of re-establishing investor business to expand. What's to be confident about?

@NoToPalins  Nah. I was just responding to a dumb quote about folks who don't believe in killing babies because they're 'inconvenient'.
@rickoevans  I was just offended by the 'one sidedness' of one of your posts & responded. Not JUST conservative extremists who are wacky.
@rickoevans  Agree wholeheartedly.  It only tends to divide the country to an even greater degree than it already is.
