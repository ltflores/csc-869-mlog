Feeling really rough. Headed home, with a stop for lunch on the way. Comfort food from Desfina- chicken lemon soup is perfect when I'm sick.

@GailSimone Significant seems like a fairly slippery term. Do you mean having an impact on story? Or something else?
oooo... my screen looks like it's in 3D now... I should definitely consider going home and passing out, before I do it in the opposite order
Have people starting hearing back about tables at New York Comic Con yet?
Almost caught up on new work since Tuesday, but still a ton left on my To Do list. Do I stick it out to try to do more, or head home to bed?
@graphicly Where I come from "motorboating" means something completely different...
@GailSimone Right, but we can play that game with white characters too. Not a lot of new comic characters stick.
@laura_hudson Right. Everyone knows it's Free Comic Boob Day.
@GailSimone Marvel has Amadeus Cho, Sister Grimm, Armor, and Hazmat off the top of my head.
So the top trending topic is to wish a Happy Birthday to a guy who is most famous for beating up his girlfriend? Congratulations, humanity.

@nickspencer @brubaker @jhickman Jumper waistcoat, surely? ;) (They actually call them "tank tops" apparently. No joke.)
.@docdestiny At the Boston Con, a TON of people told me "I can't wait to see this Huginn & Muninn book! When is it coming out?"
@DanSlott @mrtonylee @matthewdowsmith Crossover! Friendly Neighborhood Time Lord! #wishfulgeeking
RT @ncilla: Not using punctuation is an excellent way of letting people know that what you wrote really doesn't matter.
@TylerJamesComic That's similar to how I use them. I have them out on the table, but I offer them to people like it's my business card.
