Next time you go to the mall, try to buy a pair of #shoes not made in China. Are you up to the challenge?

It seems to me that #Americans spend too much time looking for reasons to be insulted. Get over yourselves and be #happy. Life's too short.
Rashad Mendenhall is an #idiot.
Rosie O'Donnell is an #idiot.
I wish it would #rain and fill the fountain up in my front yard. I hate dragging out the hose. #fail #lazy #lol
