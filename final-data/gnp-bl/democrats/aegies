@mudron frames, resolution, texture resolution - @nsuttner's right, that's practically no difference!
@mudron yeah, definitely. gta IV and red dead had major resolution differences favoring the 360.
@mudron you could also buy it on the system rockstar's games have routinely run better on this entire generation. : )
@gamersredefined i am not!
RT @mudron: There's nothing funny you spell by mixing the letters in IGN/1UP, except for maybe 1 NU PIG. WORST MERGER EVER.
i pretty much always get to work on something cool at the office. today i get to work on something fucking awesome.

@VanceTran any place in san diego.
@radiopadraic yep.
@BenKuchera the only plus side (THE ONLY PLUS SIDE) is that you can just make a new gamertag on PC if you want, since Live is free there.
@BenKuchera that doesn't make either great.
@JayFrechette download it again?
RT @therealcliffyb: Dear press, Don't bother asking about unannounced product. We're not going to randomly leak it in a QnA at a junket. ...
@leighalexander maybe you've caught a case of malaise.
@fiddlecub are you playing sanctum? we should play sanctum.
i'm wondering when EA is going to get tired of their huge games struggling in the first three months of the year.
you know, if the church of scientology couldn't bring anonymous down, i don't think sony's "ANONYMOUS DID IT" accusation will.
@tole_cover i haven't even played said game. and i won't tonight, because i'm going to bed.
and of course, i get the toothbrush in my mouth and the thing ends.
well fuck this i'mma brush my teeth while i'm waiting.
seriously folks, the 360 screen dimming thing has kicked in twice. and still, not done.
this game's introduction/training video has been going for 20 minutes and it still isn't done. there's no exaggeration here.
@primless i might try them sometime too! but not til i get a goddamned rolling pin.
after an hour and a half of preparation and cooking, i could really only eat one burrito with said tortillas. BUT IT WAS FUCKING WORTH IT.
@sterling_m check your dms.
