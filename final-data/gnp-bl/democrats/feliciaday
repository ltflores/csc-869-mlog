@Taliana83 ooooops! >:D
@BillTheScribe oh I tried labyrinth but it was a bit complicated for what I wanted but will try again!
@Taliana83 same kind of game :(
@BillTheScribe oh I'll try it. Tower defense is the best, i swear it helps me write!
Payed 10 bux for wifi on plane to get work done, ended up playing Cursed Treasure whole time http://bit.ly/iTYQTx Strategy=good for brain :D
@rachelcaine haven't you seen my vaginal-urban-fantasy goodreads shelf?  You're proudly one of my top members :D goodreads.com/feliciaday
@ponk nothing specific yet, but we just picture locked the episodes!
Also, I just proved to myself that I'll eat popcorn voraciously in any form, no matter how much like Styrafoam it tastes. #Achillessnack
Looking forward to not doing 3 projects at once & going back to tweeting about kitten vids and video games and vaginal vampire fiction.
@Neil_McNeil woot! Congrats!
@wacristiano all the seasons are there. They're just strung together like a movie, each season :)

@The_Real_Dana I always just go to jayisgames.com and search the tag listing.
@colin_walker Aw well that sucks.  YOu can come be an extra anyway, just not that part :)
@karolinatx Oh good, well, I'll make a generalized statement:  Girl Geek Pandering articles are pretty easy link-baiting. #dontfallforit
Maybe I should stop playing Escape the Room games at random Vancouver coffee shops and use my day off to do some actual work. #discipline
Guild auction closed! Thx for supporting a great charity! RT: @Weitenberner congrats on raising $3300 for The Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation!
