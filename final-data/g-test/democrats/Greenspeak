@jvdgoot I'm at least 25 years past the expiration date on that. :)
@Gordoneats no no, I'm just being a jerk :)
I don't know what's going on with this meal. Now they're serving us tiny edible (?) handbags. http://t.co/HG2ipsi
Err, this doesn't look like a burger. http://t.co/E7pzdQq
@bookscout lol :D
@Gordoneats I'm about to! :)
Now out to dinner at Chinese vegetarian restaurant. Gonna ask for a "clown burger" and see what happens.
@EmpressCortana hah, well you might be the only one in North America reading. Go to bed! (it's 5:15 pm here)
Separated at birth? http://t.co/EBcbiF3

Now at modern art museum. Hey, I just took the picture. http://t.co/mc0YFiO
@EmpressCortana yeah!
Gorgeous day in Shanghai. That's my hotel, the tower on the left. http://t.co/hYAZkfl
@garywhitta American said he enjoyed a pirated version of Book of Eli!
@garywhitta done!!
American and I go way back. I like to think of myself as American McGee's Jeff Green.
Off to visit American McGee in Shanghai!  http://t.co/1OrJO2b
@Villain15 now i do. before that, I'd been tweeting from here through my iphone's cellular signal...
@Digigala @michaelpachter @bertz09 Michael and I were listening to the Stone Roses when you were in diapers!
Ahhh. Thanks to tricky proxy settings I can now finally be on Twitter from my Mac here in Shanghai. I suppose I shouldn't tweet that.
@michaelpachter @bertz09 That gives me hope for the youth of today.
@michaelpachter @bertz09 LOVE that song, and that band.
@KimAms Somehow I knew you were going to say this.
@michaelpachter Still in Shanghai! The Genesis was an attempt to put myself back to sleep while jetlagged. :D
@IGLevine I say that to my wife every night.
@ChaosNexus  selling England...
Listened to early Genesis in the middle of the night. Sometimes they sound great, other times they sound like the most idiotic band ever.
@V_Ben every job has difficulties. Thats why it's called a job. :) no one in gaming should ever complain about it being "hard."
@nsuttner @seanalyn just read that article. Makes me want to grab him by his neck and stick him on a nighttime highway construction crew.
The PopCap Shanghai team is working on some incredible stuff. Can't wait to be able to talk about. I know, I'm a big tease! But trust me.
And big thanks to @ganglu for the great education on Twitter and other social media in China. Cool stuff.
Made it thru a full day of PowerPoint without falling asleep even while completely jetlagged. I may have drooled though.
@ThierryNguyen for you and me it is! But yeah u should be fine. That problem though is how I got boned by Virgin Atlantic.
@matthewdhager thank you!
@ThierryNguyen dude. If it's international, fix it immediately.
@matthewdhager no, and that's a really good question! I need to ask!
@KimAms it's just one guy here who got it at hong kong Disneyland, but I'll see If they're available :)
Here's the back of that shirt. http://t.co/GxPUrxC

@statuskwoh @verohime One needs not couch nor bed to be lazy, grasshopper. One needs only lazy brain. Also maybe a joint. --Sensei Green.
@taswell Shanghai is more American than America now! #Obamao
Welcome to Shanghai. Would you like some Starbucks coffee with your Dairy Queen? http://t.co/dYftcmE
@RaviCNN man, one day! Would live to visit!!
Thanks for the congrats all, and special thanks to @jason_wilson for not correcting the dangling modifier in that tweet. :)
@MrPope yeah. we talked about it a lot beforehand so it's cool...just having an anniversary "rain check" :/
She's half a world and half a day behind me as I write this from China, but today marks the 25th year my wife and I have been together.
@DavidEllis Those PS3 chumps must feel totally ripped off!
Just posted a little Q&A with Mark Barrett, the lead artist on Unpleasant Horse over at http://www.4thandbattery.com/
@kurtisaurus Aha!  Thank you!
Grats and all the best to all my friends and former co-workers at @1up and @ign. Big day for y'all--now go forth and kicketh asseth.
@peetabix It's a crazy time, and a crazy day.  I just hope my friends all get to keep doing their thing!
@andrewpfister I haven't noticed anything.
LOL  :) RT @IGN IGN teams up with UGO and 1UP to form giant list making robot. | http://go.ign.com/lxUoGk
@OldManLight Hey, my wife needed the post-its.
@donduvall It is honestly, truly, finally coming within the next couple months. :)
@TheAngryHeretic Very, very very soon.  THIS TIME WE MEAN IT.  :)
Plants vs Zombies is a mere $3.40 on Steam for PC/Mac right now! Buy it a 12th time!  My kid needs college money!
@garywhitta Yes. They lost $400 million less in 2010 because I left.
Roll a D6, yo! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54VJWHL2K3I&sns=fb
@garywhitta Hey, that's down from the $677 million they lost same time last year! This is GOOD news!
@kurtisaurus Kewl! Where are you getting those numbers from?
@jamjams hah, in this case someone sent me the link. :)  I'm not THAT vain!
@matthewdhager That's a sucker's life! I'm in it for the BIG BUCKS. (And the ladies.)
@matthewdhager Hey, I needed a private lagoon!
I knew this social media gig was going to work out. (Too bad they spelled my last name wrong, though.) http://tinyurl.com/43483y3
RT @popcap_games: PvZ turns 2 today! Happy birthday @PlantsvsZombies! http://ow.ly/4NXDt
@datstudios ok, cool. did not know that. :)
@datstudios what if it has chicken in it?
@thejoncrook homemade, and yes. :)
I would like to dedicate this tweet to the cheese quesadilla, an unheralded yet tasty and reliable food entree.
@groble Yay! And I did it without midichlorians, too!
@seanmolloy you know why you keep missing them, Molloy? Cuz you're lollygagging!
@VivasKaul @MattBodega Yes, that was The First Kerfuffle this week.
@BoutonBrian I would so totally eat Cheesy Kerfuffles.
@evil_avatar Yeah, I don't really care either way about the actual content of the story. I'm mostly interested in the word "kerfuffle" :)
@zackjewell I think it's like the Supreme Court definition of pr0n:  We know it when we see it.
@angelfan91 Ya know, if you say that in a certain way, I could take that as you flirting with me.
@TurboToaster @MattBodega LOL :)
Okay, consensus seems to be that this is not a kerfuffle. I, for one, am relieved. We need to save that word for when it's really needed.
@MattBodega the first was the earlier bitch fight over a Brink review...
Gang, how are we classifying today's Kotaku/MW3 thing? Is it another kerfuffle? Cuz that'd make two kerfuffles in one week. #kerfuffles
@InvadedSpace Well, we've TALKED about it. That's some progress!
@DarthWaya lol :D
@ChaseClark haha.  :)  Those have both been in my collection since the day they came out.
@datarez more grunge/punk stuff.  Guns N Roses were suspiciously "metal" for me back then. I've since seen the light.
Shameful confession time: I have never owned Guns N Roses' Appetite for Destruction. I just rectified that error. Please forgive me.
