Thank you, #MTA, for having car door keys available for your staff. I take back all the bad things I've said about you.
Am stuck on a train with doors that won't open. At 96th St, with tiny, struggling signal. Trying not to panic.
Thus my poll is no longer relevant. But thanks for the feedback!

Friend Poll: What's the firmer "I love you", cosigning a lease or purchasing large appliances together?
@CurrentlyPurrin Every once in a while, they really do!

@AllyBank thanks so much, but we're good. #TheLovelyGirlfriend made Chase see sense.
In other news, we found an apartment we like, but are as yet uncertain about applying. #10KtomoveisINSANE
Dreamt yesterday of my-life-as-POTUS, with @pastorbecca as Chief of Staff and @maddow as Press Secretary. #WillNeverHappen #AwesomeDreams
@katefais Love that hashtag.  We're definitely very cute. :)
@purekathryn #TheLovelyGirlfriend is working on it. She doesn't have DD (grad studentss get paid per semester) but I certainly do. UGH.
Alas, there will be no dancing for me this weekend. There will be an apartment viewing, though, and possibly a movie. #SickIsGross #JaneEyre
JP Morgan Chase tells me that they don't have monthly fee-less accounts for a couple with $100K in annual cash flow. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
Harpist in the 110th Street 1 Station this morning. Gorgeous music!
@Zero @katefais Love for the #needles!
@katefais I'm seeing Corrin for the first time in a week, so doubt I'll want to #knit. But I don't like being #WithoutYarnAndNeedles. Odd.
@CurrentlyPurrin No, but I have 2friends who are designers, &I know 1 LYS owner whom I'm trying to introduce them to. I'm a connector. :)

@ravelry Nevermind -- got it! Thanks so much for the details about how Ravelry is growing and changing.
@ravelry Where can I find out more info on both of these elements?
@ajafair @BOOKSHIP I love and miss you, but can't cope with Inception or fandom, so will have to wait. Coming to @bookbloggercon in May?
Has the attention span of a sleepy gnat; I'm thinking today's a busy-work kind of day -- meeting notes, progress reports, etc.
Left the house for 2 days without a #knitting project. Halfway through my commute, considered going back. Realized I don't have time. #Ugh.

@Zero I don't actually care about the general public, but my own company didn't take my opinion after asking for it, & are in a pickle now.
I'm really tired of being right too early for other people to accept. #mypreviousprevioustweet
For the record, I wrote a paper with the same claims in August of 2009. #myprevioustweet

I love early morning philosophical discussions with our volunteers, but today's left me very glad that I'm not standing in #Obama's shoes.
@MindyKB my birthday dinner for two was $100
#BloodyBloodyAndrewJackson was nommed for Book & Scenic Design Tonys; I was impressed by both. Will share #Arcadia thoughts after Saturday.
Celebrated a wonderful birthday yesterday, & looking forward to my 2nd present: tickets to Thursday's NYC Ballet production of Apollo.
@JMHaughey Thank you so much!
@redgypsie Hmmm... I haven't received a message from you. Why don't you email me your response & I'll introduce you to K. Same at gmail. :)
Just watched the newest member of my team push the $8 million button. I love the look of wonder and "whoa" that crossed her face.
I was all set for an hour accompanied by Mumford & Sons, and pleasantly surprised to have struck Moby instead. Yay for project-heavy Friday.
@PlaidCupcake Ooh, pretty. :)
@PlaidCupcake Pictures, please. :)
Kindness begets kindness, and rudeness is similarly self-propagating. #MyPreviousTweet
"Cafe R" just opened next to Hope Lodge, but surly cashiers and rude customers aren't convenient. I'll keep walking to Koreatown.

@JMHaughey Thanks, Jaime.
