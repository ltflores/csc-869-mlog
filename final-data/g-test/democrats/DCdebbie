GOP is trying to cut Obama health care, Medicare and Medicaid... When people say, "Republicans make me sick" they aren't lying!
Irony: GOP thinks medical term for woman's reproductive organs is vulgar, yet this year, they thought they were experts on rape definition.
Sarah Palin's family exemplifies 2 things: Abstinence-only education does NOT work, and the wealthy can continue to preach in support of it.
want to reduce the numbers of abortion? offer sex ed and access to contraception. Those against abortion are against these things as well.
Dear GOP, When you limit access to abortion, you don't make it more rare, you make it more dangerous for women.
In 2011 GOP tried to: redefine rape to limit abortion access, rid abortion 4 incest, allow murder of abortion docs as "justifiable homicide"
The woman next to me at step aerobics class kept sneezing without covering her nose. So I didn't feel bad about farting w/o covering my ass.
Trillion $$ for wars to save Americans from terrorism. If we called "disease" a terrorist that kills, would GOP fund Obama's health care?

Someone asked, "why should I pay for your sister's meds?" well, why should I pay for your wars? We are a country. United we stand.
My sister's life-saving medications cost $100,000 a year.  She's permanently disabled. Without Medicare, Mr. @ericcantor, she dies!
dear @ericcantor, you are too extreme, especially for a @gopleader. You're creating a "death panel" by denying Medicare to sick poor people.
Dear @ericcantor, you say Medicare recipients don't need it as a "safety net." you are wrong. My sister would die w/o her meds. @gopleader
What's Cantor's twitter handle? I'm going to send him a message or two about Medicare beneficiaries like my sister.
