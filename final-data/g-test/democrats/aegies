still working! possibly a little delirious!
@BaBaracus83 return to cookie mountain.
next time i hear my downstairs neighbor's yappy dogs go off i'm going to pound on the floor the way they just did in response to music.
@adamdjorgensen ...why?
@pkollar @leighalexander you two are inspiring a serious hank moody moment on this coast.
@pkollar oh, no. you not liking homefront makes you a superior human being.
and now i'll listen to orenda fink's album, since it comes the closest to that dirty spiritual kind of thing.
@pkollar you're a bad person.
@DaemZero it just doesn't have that sort of forlorn, furious energy.
@leighalexander right, and the energy at "teeth gnashing, masticating this dumb tongue" is powerful. of course i'm listening to it now.
@leighalexander and so many different parts to secretly sing along to when no one else is around : x
@leighalexander trumpet/saxophone
@leighalexander sex and religion, guilt and desire. it's powerful shit. and, you know. the trumpet.
my favorite tv on the radio song is "blues from down here," and i just don't think they're ever going to do a song like that again.
@jimreilly it's called "a message."
@DavidEllis me personally? i'm getting to do shit i never would have dreamed i'd be able to do for any games site/publication, ever.
almost every job you'll ever want to do is preceded by a job doing some shitty things you wish you weren't doing.
@dkaszor there is. but they all kind of suck, and all of them have quirks.
@pkollar @andrewpfister you know what's worse than a CMS? handcoding your shit. welcome to the internet post-2003.
@pkollar @nsuttner YOU MEAN WORKING IN THE GAMES PRESS REQUIRES ACTUAL "WORK"?!?! THAT SOUNDS BORING!
@dirtytea THE CLEANEST SITE DESIGN IN THE WORLD.
@dirtytea m.ign.com
@Videogamegirl digging the new hair.
@lizziecuevas ohhhh god you're fucking killing me with these.
@leighalexander oh gross.
@leighalexander if you want to be able to write, i'd advise half a muscle relaxer until you don't need to concentrate anymore.
@leighalexander is this a recurring issue? if not, go to the doctor. you'll get vicodin and muscle relaxers.
@audacious_hope when was this text sent?!
@audacious_hope i'm taking you to dinner in a couple of weeks, so fucking help me.
@agentbizzle so @scott_bromley will be sitting out this week then?
@agentbizzle you wouldn't run out of comedy buttons if you stopped pouring water into your laptop.
@SamitSarkar could be xbl issues right now.
@BaBaracus83 you can't direct that argument at people who don't give a shit about people.
@agentbizzle "The Day the Earth Ran Out of Ideas."
@agentbizzle i believe that's in the general vicinity of the "triforce ferris wheel."
@agentbizzle so it's a step up from sisqo with a jager problem then?
@TheMoronMike i'm also very curious.
was going to write a preview of Sanctum, but captivate got in the way. now i have the full version in my steam account. review it is!
this could be a big deal. RT @IGN: Are free-to-play games coming to Xbox Live next year? http://go.ign.com/hvkO4f
"promise" is a scary word in all of its forms.
@MRSallee and i would get to hear you swear!
@Karaya_One and i could not disagree more with that statement. acceptance of differences is part of community.
@Karaya_One it didn't actually. that coincided with the concerted push to dismantle the welfare state in the late 70s-80s.
@Karaya_One and i would contend that banding together, providing for each other, helping, is the crux of civilization.
@PwamCider listen to @MRSallee. he's right.
@MRSallee indeed. so, when are you going to fix those fucking potholes? also, could you stop tearing up second during the week?
@MRSallee i didn't realize you paved all those roads yourself!
@notaxation i think they're betting on general ignorance as to how much the federal budget is and what it goes to, which isn't a bad bet.
@notaxation right, and the fighter in me wants to say "it's red meat for their base, so they can get what they want." which it is, but.
@XaiaX it's totally true. but it's spoiled bullshit to crucify the people whose job it is to make things work for settling for good.
@mudron frames, resolution, texture resolution - @nsuttner's right, that's practically no difference!
@mudron yeah, definitely. gta IV and red dead had major resolution differences favoring the 360.
@mudron you could also buy it on the system rockstar's games have routinely run better on this entire generation. : )
@gamersredefined i am not!
RT @mudron: There's nothing funny you spell by mixing the letters in IGN/1UP, except for maybe 1 NU PIG. WORST MERGER EVER.
i pretty much always get to work on something cool at the office. today i get to work on something fucking awesome.
RT @hilarygoldstein: IGN + 1UP thoughts from a dude who works @ign http://t.co/UktrPeK
@VanceTran any place in san diego.
@radiopadraic yep.
@BenKuchera the only plus side (THE ONLY PLUS SIDE) is that you can just make a new gamertag on PC if you want, since Live is free there.
@BenKuchera that doesn't make either great.
@JayFrechette download it again?
RT @therealcliffyb: Dear press, Don't bother asking about unannounced product. We're not going to randomly leak it in a QnA at a junket. ...
@leighalexander maybe you've caught a case of malaise.
@fiddlecub are you playing sanctum? we should play sanctum.
i'm wondering when EA is going to get tired of their huge games struggling in the first three months of the year.
you know, if the church of scientology couldn't bring anonymous down, i don't think sony's "ANONYMOUS DID IT" accusation will.
@tole_cover i haven't even played said game. and i won't tonight, because i'm going to bed.
and of course, i get the toothbrush in my mouth and the thing ends.
well fuck this i'mma brush my teeth while i'm waiting.
seriously folks, the 360 screen dimming thing has kicked in twice. and still, not done.
this game's introduction/training video has been going for 20 minutes and it still isn't done. there's no exaggeration here.
@primless i might try them sometime too! but not til i get a goddamned rolling pin.
after an hour and a half of preparation and cooking, i could really only eat one burrito with said tortillas. BUT IT WAS FUCKING WORTH IT.
@sterling_m check your dms.
@primless HA!
@hilarygoldstein still waiting on those calculators sir.
@hilarygoldstein i do what i can! #hilarysipadautocorrectsinfunnyways
woo! i've hit the clear mucus threshold! (hey, you hit the follow button. ) also, i currently have the deepest voice in the games press.
goddamn kinect sports. microsoft says it's "sold" (shipped?) 3 million units since november.
@primless i'm trying not to : (
@Agies yessir.
@chespace you! you have a DM sir.
so. like. i could have ice cream if i wanted, right? for my sore throat? right?
RT @peyelon: @aegies  Mind RTing another Gears code? MP9HD-6JTPD-GRVG2-GRJJ6-MG7MZ  Thank you!
Got a review game today 5 weeks early, which is a big relief given the release timing.
modern warfare 3 - we put a bird on it: http://is.gd/GngajA
cause my voice, she be gone. RT @snakpakk: I shall be making my first appearance on Rebel FM tonight. #MyIGN
@primless my goodness that sounds interesting.
@MRHOOTS no clue : (
