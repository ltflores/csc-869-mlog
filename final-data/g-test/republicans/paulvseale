@reneehulshof LOL. You have a point there. :)
@reneehulshof of course what makes all this the more difficult is the closeness to being insolvent. The room for error is much less.
@reneehulshof I am a firm believer in Reagan's principle of getting 80% than "going over the cliff with your flag flying high"
@reneehulshof we really cant swing for the fences until we get the senate and presidency back.. or at least one of the two.
@reneehulshof That doesnt mean we roll over either. That does mean if Dems want, say debt limit increased, then we can leverage reforms.
@reneehulshof With Dems controlling senate. White House and media we should give it our best shot. Glad we are making progress.
@reneehulshof You are correct, though. As I mentioned somone else earlier - Im relieved, but not happy over the agreement.
100% Correct. MT @reneehulshof You should never place another person--political, celebrity, star or other--on a pedestal. They are human.
