OBL son Omar: burying Osama at sea "demeans and humiliates his family". Right. We should've buried him under a collapsed building. #tcot
AP survey showing 60% Obama approval skewed sample to Dems by 17 points. Thought it was Associated Press. Maybe it was Artful Polling. #tcot
CA teacher complaint: "you can't have 1st class teaching on a 3rd World budget". Sure managed to prove the opposite is true, though. #tcot
MSNBC's Schultz sued for $100K by man claiming he got Schultz into TV. How long until people start suing that guy for the same reason? #tcot
Hillary: China not "a threat to the US". Yeah, nuclear weapons and $1 trillion in US bonds. What could they threaten us with? #tcot
