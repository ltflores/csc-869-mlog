@mrenygma yes, it was a CableCARD issue for us as well. I'm working with them tomorrow to try and fix it.
@thevowel BAM! It was London, lots of walking to the tube and to shoots. I think I had my second best day steps-wise that week.
I'll be hosting the live Digg Dialogg today with @guykawasaki at 1:30 PT: http://revision3.com/watch

@dudeslife it was more methodology rather than recipes!
Mixology class was great, though I'm totally still the kiss-ass that tries to answer all of the teachers questions before anyone else. #nerd
@ctomasi hah! that's cute.
@paulandstorm yes, and I'll wear an eyepatch.
@Fee501st I will try.
Taking a mixology class today! #booze #backupplan
@escapist to be fair, the Beats line is actually pretty good, quality-wise. That being said, Monster Cable (who makes them) can suck it.
The cat @mrlittlejeans is purring like he actually missed me. Or he might just have a particularly violent hairball.
@sporfle thanks for looking out though, that has happened before and it's pretty lame!
@sporfle of course, I host a web series for them ;)
Sweet! RT @feliciaday: Gratz to The Annoying Orange!  They just released a cool iPhone game: Kitchen Carnage. http://t.co/2gfqgBu

Last night in London! Gonna drink some beers and pass out before the long flight tomorrow. Can't believe the awesome weather we had!!
@177aria AH! Of course, and hello! He's doing great in London, busting his butt as always!
@177aria we drive to most locations, unless it's very far away! Which Chris do you mean?
