On the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight, I was notified that my iPad with the engraving of "cupcakes + rockets" had shipped.

Surrounded by vegetarian programmers!
omg, Cute Roulette: http://cuteroulette.com you're welcome.
Wow, you can get a 23andMe kit for free tomorrow: http://is.gd/d3Z1BN Tempting... (thx @erigentry)
@Dave_Stein all depends on what technologies/experiments you want to use and what rocket launch deal you get, so yeah, it can vary widely.
@changelogshow thanks for the write up! Just a quick correction: http://spacehack.org is my site, my friends made spacelog (not me).
@listrophy I'll be doing dinner at the Plant Cafe if you signed up for that one! Otherwise I'll be around throughout the day.
@calavera hadn't seen it before - will have to check it out, thanks!
@calavera @auser @jackdanger thanks so much :)
Thanks to everyone at #CodeConf ! Lovely to geek out about space stuff with such a super nice crowd.
Ha! People now think I live in New Zealand thanks to a vague speaker intro. It's cool, I can move.
RT @iangreenleaf: Turns out anyone (really) can make significant contributions to space exploration: http://spacehack.org

The Now: enjoying a lovely view of SF before my talk at #CodeConf tomorrow http://flic.kr/p/9x2igp
CodeConf speaker + githubber dinner! Definitely amusing ideas going around.
@Funzafunza yay, awesome!
@funzafunza did you ever post the interview from SXSW? just curious :)
@CameronNeylon @davidwhogg there's also http://www.exquisitetweets.com/ that nicely lays out all the tweets onto one URL.
@keithdok great interview choices for SuicideGirls! happy to see science geeks making appearances. (i briefly used to write columns on SG)
Prepping for a full weekend at #codeconf !
A talk by @mike_ftw for all freelancers to watch about contracts, etc.: http://vimeo.com/22053820 (I learned about kill fees the hard way)
@davidwhogg just caught your great talk from #dotastro & tweeted it out (left Oxford early). wish i caught you in person, maybe next year!
Good talk on the computer science behind Astrometry.net: http://is.gd/fGn4gh you may remember them from Flickr http://is.gd/Acpnx1 #dotastro
...I apparently can't read a respectable article about physics without thinking that Tevatron would make a great Transformers robot name.
There should be Autobot+Decepticon Transformers called Tevatron, &when their powers collide, they create Higgs Bosotron! http://is.gd/4Pr7vQ
Packing up at New College in Oxford, headed to Heathrow and then SFO. Had a great time with everyone at #dotastro !
In case you're in the mood for some hot rocket porn: http://www.spacex.com/falcon_heavy.php 3.8 million pounds of liftoff thrust, oh yeah.
Virgin Oceanic will expand the reach of human exploration on our planet: http://www.virginoceanic.com/ (so incredibly exciting!)
@k_lau omg, SO cool! i've been wanting to befriend more oceanic explorer types - would be great to bring in to science hackery type stuff...
@schingler sure! start an email thread about it, maybe?
Properly feel like I'm in a movie. Walking around a castle in Oxford in the rain.
@SpaceXer if I wanted to attend a SpaceX launch (which I very much do!), who/what should I interface w/? My email is ariel@arielwaldman.com
@flaneur I'm short on $ and time, so I'm not going to go. Not too sad, I do actually really want to see a SpaceX launch.
Hearing the NASA STS-134 space shuttle launch is being delayed to April 29th. Looks like I won't go. Hope to catch a SpaceX launch someday.
