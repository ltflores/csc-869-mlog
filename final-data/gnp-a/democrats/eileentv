Liking X Construction (today's free Amazon app).  But the screams of terror when a train falls,  really makes you feel like a failure!

@bryanjager my Nexus S is horrible with battery life -- even on standby. I find myself constantly conserving. I need a spare batt
@bryanjager you must be using it more than me. I tried to emulate how I use my iPad. Reading, videos, some gaming, minor browsing and email
@MacintoshAddict very close and I tried to use it the same way I use my iPad
@PatrickKaine I hadn't charged it for 2 days and when I gave it to Jason it was at 64%
@ronxo I am! :) This game got really exciting. I turned it on and it was 7-1
@ronxo hey, I'm watching that game on the MLB at bat app :)
I don't think I gave the XOOM enough credit on @androidshow. Battery life is awesome, and probably why it's so heavy!
@VodooXTC I LOVE reading on a tablet - including the XOOM. It sucks when I have to turn it off at the beginning of a flight. @raygun01
@HateBadDesign he took mine. But I used the company card to buy it, so it's kinda his too!
Just loaned the XOOM to @raygun01. Wonder what he'll think of it? Dun-dun-dun.
listening to "boy" by Ra Ra Riot on Play. "Testing Play for Android " http://bit.ly/hzcX0D
I'm paranoid today ;) ♫ http://sdtk.fm/fWlQ69 #soundtracking
