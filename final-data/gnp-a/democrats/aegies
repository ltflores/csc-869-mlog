still working! possibly a little delirious!
@BaBaracus83 return to cookie mountain.
next time i hear my downstairs neighbor's yappy dogs go off i'm going to pound on the floor the way they just did in response to music.
@adamdjorgensen ...why?
@pkollar @leighalexander you two are inspiring a serious hank moody moment on this coast.
@pkollar oh, no. you not liking homefront makes you a superior human being.
and now i'll listen to orenda fink's album, since it comes the closest to that dirty spiritual kind of thing.
@pkollar you're a bad person.
@DaemZero it just doesn't have that sort of forlorn, furious energy.
@leighalexander right, and the energy at "teeth gnashing, masticating this dumb tongue" is powerful. of course i'm listening to it now.
@leighalexander and so many different parts to secretly sing along to when no one else is around : x
@leighalexander trumpet/saxophone
@leighalexander sex and religion, guilt and desire. it's powerful shit. and, you know. the trumpet.
my favorite tv on the radio song is "blues from down here," and i just don't think they're ever going to do a song like that again.
@jimreilly it's called "a message."
@DavidEllis me personally? i'm getting to do shit i never would have dreamed i'd be able to do for any games site/publication, ever.
almost every job you'll ever want to do is preceded by a job doing some shitty things you wish you weren't doing.
@dkaszor there is. but they all kind of suck, and all of them have quirks.
@pkollar @andrewpfister you know what's worse than a CMS? handcoding your shit. welcome to the internet post-2003.
@pkollar @nsuttner YOU MEAN WORKING IN THE GAMES PRESS REQUIRES ACTUAL "WORK"?!?! THAT SOUNDS BORING!
@dirtytea THE CLEANEST SITE DESIGN IN THE WORLD.
@dirtytea m.ign.com
@Videogamegirl digging the new hair.
@lizziecuevas ohhhh god you're fucking killing me with these.
@leighalexander oh gross.
@leighalexander if you want to be able to write, i'd advise half a muscle relaxer until you don't need to concentrate anymore.
@leighalexander is this a recurring issue? if not, go to the doctor. you'll get vicodin and muscle relaxers.
@audacious_hope when was this text sent?!
@audacious_hope i'm taking you to dinner in a couple of weeks, so fucking help me.
@agentbizzle so @scott_bromley will be sitting out this week then?
@agentbizzle you wouldn't run out of comedy buttons if you stopped pouring water into your laptop.
@SamitSarkar could be xbl issues right now.
@BaBaracus83 you can't direct that argument at people who don't give a shit about people.
@agentbizzle "The Day the Earth Ran Out of Ideas."
@agentbizzle i believe that's in the general vicinity of the "triforce ferris wheel."
@agentbizzle so it's a step up from sisqo with a jager problem then?
@TheMoronMike i'm also very curious.
was going to write a preview of Sanctum, but captivate got in the way. now i have the full version in my steam account. review it is!
this could be a big deal. RT @IGN: Are free-to-play games coming to Xbox Live next year? http://go.ign.com/hvkO4f
"promise" is a scary word in all of its forms.
@MRSallee and i would get to hear you swear!
@Karaya_One and i could not disagree more with that statement. acceptance of differences is part of community.
@Karaya_One it didn't actually. that coincided with the concerted push to dismantle the welfare state in the late 70s-80s.
@Karaya_One and i would contend that banding together, providing for each other, helping, is the crux of civilization.
@PwamCider listen to @MRSallee. he's right.
@MRSallee indeed. so, when are you going to fix those fucking potholes? also, could you stop tearing up second during the week?
@MRSallee i didn't realize you paved all those roads yourself!
@notaxation i think they're betting on general ignorance as to how much the federal budget is and what it goes to, which isn't a bad bet.
@notaxation right, and the fighter in me wants to say "it's red meat for their base, so they can get what they want." which it is, but.
@XaiaX it's totally true. but it's spoiled bullshit to crucify the people whose job it is to make things work for settling for good.
