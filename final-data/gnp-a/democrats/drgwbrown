@n8wide @squintinginfog The willingness to admit we do not know everything, or have it perfect ourselves, also makes a huge difference. :-)
It is hard to hate anyone if you truly believe God chooses to love everyone.
Taking third oldest daughter to doctor in Louisville tomorrow.  Time to stop gifting the world with my frustration & anger. Shalom.
@JeffersonObama I get frustrated too. I want him to do everything I want--end the wars, tax the wealthy, support workers--Pres can't do all
@JeffersonObama It is sad to watch Presidents age in office trying to do the impossible for the ungrateful.
@JeffersonObama I think we have lost our minds. We elect him, we fill one half of Congress with Tea Party, and then we complain.
@JeffersonObama I'm old enough to remember when the person who won became "our" President. Now its attack from day one, even from supporters

OK, fed up, done mouthing off, doesn't help anyway, headed to the climbing gym.
@DianeRavitch They know! Keeping the attention on school as cause avoids having to deal with refusing to pay workers & increasing poverty!
GOP strategies for global warming & economic failure the same. Misdirect attention with phony issues. Education is the false issue for econ.
If Indiana believes they have a way to actually determine ineffective teachers, why keep them at all? And, I am a union rep.
There is no way an administrator in our consolidated schools can evaluate every teacher every year.
@kinnick72 I am both a teacher and a professor of education and I am ready to leave. Have two daughters trying to enter the profession :-(
Proposal would move students away from ineffective teachers - 14 WFIE, Evansville, Henderson, Owensboro http://t.co/kiO57Dt via @AddThis

What am I missing on the change in NBC? No coverage of labor rallies. Now explain gas price inflation by asking oil spokesman only? WTH?
@DianeRavitch 2/2 But, if school has to place w ineffective a second year must notify parents! Can't imagine admin eval'ing all every year.
@DianeRavitch IN said to be considering plan to evaluate teachers yearly, label ineffective ones, allow children placed w them one year 1/2
Shirley Maclaine on Oprah talking about UFO's over her hot tub. I am guessing they took home a negative report.  She cracks me up.
Long rainy day w too much nonsense. :-/ (@ Greg Brown) http://4sq.com/gHBUxf
@JeffersonObama Yes, it is very sad. I just have a personal connection to Sudan and it amazes me how many places are being destroyed.
@JeffersonObama Sudan blew itself up while we sat back and ignored decades of genocide as well.
@revnaomi Amazing, wonderful, and blessed.
@revnaomi Pointed to our crosses as connection with Ethiopian boy across languages; he said in words I understood "I love you as God loves."
This morning's weather is interesting after yesterday's sermon. In the dark, even a small light shines brightly. Be light.

@ke5mkt A friend's family has had a block of tickets for years & I started going with him. This year is 100th race so should be exciting
Sad: Nature says biggest threat to Cuba's fantastic wildlife is end of embargo and flood of us showing up as tourists.
@ke5mkt My next break will be end of May for the 500. My wife is going with me this year.
@ke5mkt Any plans for one soon?
@ke5mkt So, how are things otherwise?
@Purplegrass So how do we clone Bernie Sanders?
Watching the program Nature, episode shot in Cuba.  Such amazing beauty.
When you set up a situation to evaluate people on if they achieve a statistical impossibility, the msg is clear: lie, cheat, or leave.

@mike__friesen Thanks, it was a blessing to be invited.
OK, more pressing need time to get some dinner with wife and daughter. peace
@mike__friesen These are very friendly country people with a pretty traditional read on the Bible. So, just gently inviting deeper.
@rev3j @orpheus42 @n8wide Agreed. It flies in the face of every positive argument. Still haven't read much on that side and its not all his.
@mike__friesen Tried not to overdo the mystical for this group but still invite them in the direction of experiencing God not just studying.
