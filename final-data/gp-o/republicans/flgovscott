God bless our great state and all of you. Let’s get to work! #sayfie #StateoftheState
"With new jobs and an education system full of new energy, we’ll plot the course for a brighter future." #StateoftheState
"Our success will be the model for the nation."
Ronald Reagan once described America as a place ‘Unimpressed with what others say is impossible.” I think that's especially true about Fla.
"Working together we can do incredible things if we stand together with the courage of our convictions."
Don’t blink... Keep faith with the Floridians who supported you because you said "I believe in the American Dream.”
I didn’t fight to become Gov. of the greatest state in nation to settle for a status quo that doesn’t promote the potential of our people.
"We have a unique opportunity to put government back in its proper place and show the nation how private sector growth leads to prosperity."
"State government will be smart, lean, affordable and focused only on its core missions"
Imagine with me what Fla. will be like once we turn our state around. Fla. WILL be the leading job creator over the next 8 years.
There are ways to save money and provide better care by adopting market principles and giving patients more choice.
We are streamlining the functions of state agencies to save money and provide better service for taxpayers.
"Most Floridians have had to tighten their belts. The state needs to do the same thing." #StateoftheState #Sayfie
Florida can become the most innovative and effective place in the country to educate the workforce of the future.
Sonia Mitchell of FL Intrnl Academy is here Her charter school moved from F to an A b/c of great teachers & measurements of student outcomes
"Individual student learning must be the touchstone for all our decisions" #StateoftheState
"Many new approaches (to education) offer better outcomes without increasing costs." #StateoftheState #Sayfie
On behalf of millions of Floridians who are desperate for new jobs, I ask you (the legislature) to pass our "jobs" budget promptly.
Last month I delivered to you a budget that puts that plan into action and cuts taxes by Two Billion dollars http://bit.ly/icRYeC
I want to encourage the legislature to become Jobs Ambassadors & direct new prospects to me so we can work together to find potential growth
My "jobs" budget is targeted to create private sector jobs,  increase accountability and reduce the size of government http://bit.ly/icRYeC
We intend to watch state spending like a hawk. We sold the state airplanes http://bit.ly/e9mZhk
On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline & every contract exceeding $1 million http://bit.ly/eu0hNH
“Doing what must be done will not make me – ‘Most Popular.’ But I’m determined to make Florida – ‘Most Likely to Succeed’” #StateoftheState
“The first step to better times is acknowledging that Government cannot afford what some have come to expect.”
"Government always takes more than it gives back." #StateoftheState #Sayfie
For years, politicians have not dared to face our financial problems. Politics prevailed, even when the numbers did not add up
"We also want to recognize the bravery and the sacrifices of all of our law enforcement officers here in Florida"
Members of @FLGuard as well as Florida soldiers and airmen who have returned from duty abroad are in attendance tonight. #StateoftheState
