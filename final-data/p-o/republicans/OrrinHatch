It was a random sampling of Utahns in Davis Co., including I's, D's, and R's. I'm not claiming it was a scientific sample, just interesting.
Final question of the evening was about whether to repeal obamacare- yes was 85% no was 15%. Great call. Thanks Davis County!
To reduce the federal debt, 73% of people on call said reduce spending, 2% said raise taxes and 25% said do both. Very interesting!
We just did a poll on my tele-townhall and 92% of people on the call support a balanced budget amendment.
