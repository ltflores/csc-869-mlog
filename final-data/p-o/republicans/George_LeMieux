Gov. Scott is right to push for tax cuts. It's the people's money, not the government's, & cutting corp. taxes will help create jobs.
RT @JohnCornyn: Sen. Reid says Tea Party will "disappear."  Also said Iraq war lost before surge begun.  Hard to be wrong all the time!

Preventing tax increase & stopping $1.1 trillion spending bill gives hope. Congress is starting to listen to the people. #sayfie
Senate Republicans have stood strong!  No 2,000 page, pork laden, omnibus spending bill.
A 1 page continuing resolution to keep  government running or a 1,900+ page pork laden, omnibus spending bill.  Which do you prefer?
Senate Ds should not cram 2,000 page spending bill and arms control treaty with Russians into 1 week!  http://twitpic.com/3g84xf #sayfie
