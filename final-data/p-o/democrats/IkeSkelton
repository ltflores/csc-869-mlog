Honoring Those Who Serve on September 11th http://ow.ly/2DxlY #911
We will never forget.
As we remember today, we must renew our commitment to do all that is necessary to protect our families, our communities, and our nation.
On #911, the world got to see America at its best–a nation coming together & thousands of patriots coming forward to serve & protect the US
We remember those who were killed and pay tribute to those who have fought and died to protect our nation against further terrorist attacks.

@CommerceGov announced big investment in MO's high-speed Internet infrastructure - will expand coverage to 600,000 homes & 57,000 businesses
Congress must continue supporting loan guarantees & tax cuts for these businesses - best way to create jobs in rural Missouri

It was a pleasure visiting with Charlie and with other @FarmBureau members in Bates County.
Last Thursday, I honored Missouri @FarmBureau President Charlie Kruse for his dedication to Show-Me State agriculture.
Increased border security and fully paid for investments in education – a good day for Missouri’s working families
I just voted to invest in the education of our children - paid for by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship #jobs overseas
A quality education is our nation’s best “jobs” program and is essential to regaining America’s competitive advantage in the world.
Just voted to hire 1000 additional Border Patrol agents, improve border fencing, and increase the # of unmanned aircraft
My #Jobs & Business Tour begins today. Small businesses are true job creators - they work everyday to pull us out of this recession

I am pleased that a VA funding bill passed by the House tonight expands care for those suffering from conditions like depression and #PTSD
In many of the Roundtables I've held, veterans have routinely expressed the need for more mental health resources at the @DeptVetAffairs
The bill the House is considering now will set aside these resources for rural health outreach and more.
Did you know that +40% of veterans live in rural areas?  It's important Congress sets aside resources specifically for rural health outreach
If you haven’t filled out a #Census form or spoken to a Census representative in person, call 888-872-6868 and make sure you’re counted.
Missouri can’t afford to lose a seat at the table after this year’s #Census. That’s why it’s critical that you be counted.

Supporting our troops is my top priority - I'm pleased the House, after much urging on my part, has sent our military the money they need
Small Business Administration (@SmallBusinessAd) loans, which I voted to extend today, play a vital role in doing just that.
While our warriors fight for us overseas, we must protect the economic security of the small businesses that drive our local economies.

Now, it’s up to the Senate to finally extend this safety net to millions of Americans.
That's why I supported an extension of the emergency unemployment compensation program, which passed the House in a bipartisan vote 270-135
Times have been tough for many families & it's up to Congress to extend unemployment benefits to those who have lost their jobs

Today’s ruling affirms an individual’s right to own a gun for self-defense - a right that we in rural Missouri have long held sacred.
I'm pleased that the Supreme Court made clear that our rights under the 2nd Amendment apply equally to federal, state, and local governments
These targeted sanctions will hopefully head off a real threat. They're our best hope of dissuading #Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
Last night, I voted in favor of H.R. 2194, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.
Moving forward, I will remain in contact with the Corps. I commend them for their work to protect our communities, homes, and livelihoods.
