@DianeRavitch There is no establishment vs reform. That's about adults. Education should be about the kids & about what works
@jimconn especially those who care enough to be active in their unions!
@FrankBeard There is no silver bullet to "fix" ed, but the hard working TFAers do make a difference in the lives of children every day
@FrankBeard Is TFA too establishment? Or r they shaking things up too much? pls b consistent
@DianeRavitch So you think TFA is too establishment, doesn't shake things up enough?
Amazed that Teach for America has h8rs
@DianeRavitch couldn't let that go by; TFA is NOT establishmnt in any way/shape/form; still providing creative disruption after 20 yrs!

@DianeRavitch  Investment alone isn't enough, reform is also needed. Turning around poorly performing charters and district-run schools
@DianeRavitch "there is little or no relationship between spending and test score outcomes" is hardly a progressive argument.
