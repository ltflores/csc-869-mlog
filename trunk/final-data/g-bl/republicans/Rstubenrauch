The PR person who wrote the apology blog for @R_Mendenhall did an okay job.  Notice he didn't attempt to explain the 9/11 conspiracy stuff?
@mattdole Wow. Wonder how many people get the R4 joke. You may need some non-political followers if everyone does.
Apparently Rashard Mendenhall is a 9/11 conspiracy theorist who thinks OBL was framed. Another reason to hate the Steelers.
Apparently, Sony doesn't deal with data or crisis well. Hey Microsoft, sell an Xbox that plays BlueRay!
