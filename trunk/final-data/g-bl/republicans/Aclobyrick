Call me a conspiracy nut, but there is something not right here.
That's what makes Liberals and there Progressive friends such as joke! All that Human Rights dribble except when it doesn't fit their agenda
I think they executed Bin Laden!  To messy to do the trial thing.  Look at Zow Whaherie, or what ever his name is and that mess.
There were at least 20 people in the photo I was.  They know exactly what happened.  Was he, Bin laden armed?, or did the execute him?
The reporting was that the Pre's and staff watched the whole thing on a live feed via satellite.
And so did you!  It was plastered all over the Media.
Isn't it amazing, no one seems to know what actually happened that nightwith  Ben Laden?  I saw a photo of the Pre's and his chums watching!
@michellemalkin No kidding!!!!!!
@sk45202 Obama didn't do crap!  Our Military and long time commanders mad this happen  Next thing you'll be saying is it over.
Had a dream.  U.S. city lost via nuke. Drastic change, All Muslims interned, walls built, turmoil over Rights, Freedom lost.
Who is John Galt?
