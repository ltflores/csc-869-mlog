So who's going to rely on Project Democracy in the next election? #yegcentre
@NDs4MaryMacD so the reality check was Lewis came out on top, as many had predicted. Could have done better if more people saw it this way.

@Chloe_Oxley point proven on the non-left LPC. Keep harping on right wing talking points and you'll be perpetually exiled to third party.
@Chloe_Oxley SK, MB, BC, NS. Could also look to Sweden, Norway etc etc for int'l examples. #yegfed
@Chloe_Oxley SK, MB, BC, NS. No link needed. Glad to see you won't be one of the opportunists calling for a merger.
Remember Canada. UK Labour has been elected many times without Liberals. You don't need them anymore. #elxn41 #cdnpoli #yegfed
Before anyone starts on this whole unite the left nonsense, can someone actually show that the #LPC are remotely left? Link? #yegfed
RT @BRinYEG: I have to say how impressed I was with @LewisCardinal. Thoughtful and genuine, he deserved his strong showing. #yegfed
@CRUSHPMHarper I guess MacDonald should have stood down for the superior campaign. NDs up 11, Libs continue downward trend.
RT @z_todd: I refuse to throw in the towel. If anything this should galvanize the left. We've gotta fight!

#gpc voting friend is volunteering for @lewiscardinal to get out the vote today. #yegcentre has a choice. #yegfed

Am I late on sharing this? Lightbody has the money quote (re: Pirate party.) http://bit.ly/kpiHvK #yegfed #yegcentre

@KevinTaron if I were a progressive, why would I vote for a right wing lpc over a moderately progressive ndp?
This mary mob business is nearly as embarrassing as the Ed Broadbent rap. I want to forget both. #yegfed
Looking forward to a diminished presence for Iggy and Harper tomorrow. Neither are friends of progressive Canadians. #yegfed
