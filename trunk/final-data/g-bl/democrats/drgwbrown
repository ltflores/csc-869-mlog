We can't make it better, but we can endure it together -- and somehow that makes it better. Shalom.
Climbing done, pub group done, wife on the way home, good day.

@kAtAstic10 no doubt. Of course the networks take polls that say people think what the network told them for days & call that news too!
@kAtAstic10 Agree again! Tired of seeing even "news" feeds linking to blogs. Kids study "fact" and "opinion" in the primary grades!
Bright sunshine school to start on schedule (@ Hebron Elementary School) http://4sq.com/j8IXaT
@kAtAstic10 Understand, thought maybe we had an escalating agreement going, but did not want you to think I was saying something different.
@kAtAstic10 I agreed with you. You keep responding as if I am arguing.
Local low turn out primary results on news: still say turn out would have been much heavier with none of the above on the ballot. pickaloser

RT @cgcrutchfield: I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T GET MORE CELEBRITIES INVOLVED IN DISASTER RELIEF!!! PLEASE RT!!!!!   #WeAreAlabama
RT @TerryRamoneSmit: Why in the Hell is #WEareAlabama not trending? Who do we have to get to make this trend?
@existentialfish Seems all we do now is say how everything proves "us" right and the "other side" evil. Not the society I hope to live in.
@scotmcknight Ha!
RT @Ihnatko: Happy 92nd birthday to the great, great Pete Seeger. Here's a fab Letterman performance from 2008. Â» http://bit.ly/iCPDIe
@existentialfish That was a mandatory RT!
RT @existentialfish: Is it not just amazing how Osama's death just coincidentally reinforces the ideas that everyone had about everythin ...
@scotmcknight Great picture! Which part of the country?
@kAtAstic10 Feel the same way about all the speculation on whether he was killed "correctly." They did the job they were sent to do.
