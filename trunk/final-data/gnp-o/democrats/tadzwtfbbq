Seriously? An office opening is your gripe of the day? Shouldn't you Tories be busy drooling over Scott Walker? #yegfed #priorities
@DavidStaplesYEG I imagine their disbelief in climate change helps fuel their anti-transit stance.
@DavidStaplesYEG muni gov't, yes, or even private contractors through them, but not with provincial dollars, if im reading them right.
@DavidStaplesYEG apparently private companies building transit with public funding is bad, but private health care with public funds is ok.

@richardeinarson where people fit less important than what's being done. right wing ideas got us where we are. it's time that stopped.
@noleftandright it's better than a Morton or WAP budget, to be sure, but let's not pretend it's in all of our best interests. #ableg

@richardeinarson I'd disagree. After 70+ years of right-wing rule, a change in power, influence and direction is necessary.
@richardeinarson one of the #abparty leadership candidates finds Milton Freidman inspiring. *shudder*
@richardeinarson I'm not so sure. #abparty moderate/post-partisan rhetoric serves to marginalize voices on the left.
@richardeinarson not as concerned with process as result. What you will do more important than how.

Do #wrp or #pcaa have a position on reckless union busting in Wisconsin? should we expect more of the same at #ableg if they get the chance?
So awesome to see millions of tax dollars given to private provider profits while we have a LTC shortage. #ableg
@BrockWHarrison has #wrp made it clear where they stand on providing public funds for profitable private health care providers? #ableg
@BrockWHarrison Also, doesn't hurt to be clear. Social democracy is not socialism. #ableg
@BrockWHarrison Strong regulation helps with accountability. Social dem taxation ensures it's funded well too. No gibberish there. #ableg

@RAndersonMLA it sounds like #wrp favours cpp style pension vs voluntary. Why not expand cpp to address issues with benefits? #ableg
@RAndersonMLA reducing regulation on LTC, assisted living, sounds like recipe for disaster. #ableg
