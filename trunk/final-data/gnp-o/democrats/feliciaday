@rwcopple I'm having a camomile tea in my underwear.  That's the rockingest Sat night ever, hah.
@colinferg @jonrog1 @wilw jeLous!
Why is music at parties so loud?! Having to Scream in people's faces to talk is un-fun, and makes me paranoid about what I ate for dinner.

Up very early to see some smart peeps on "Social TV" panel #SXSWi.  @gavinpurcell @moth I'm up!
I'd definitely say SXSW is a bigger party con than Comicon, but instead of posing with Cosplayers, people are posing with iPad 2s haha.
@stefanie So nice to meet you! Sorry it was a little hectic and I couldn't talk more :)
@thebanite Thank you.  I got way too excited about that toy.  Also because I dragged 8 people to check it out, so excited it showed up :)

@brianshaler lol I wasn't selling anything I was showing him, since I dragged those guys over through twitter guilt :)

@evelinestays Thank you so much for the raving, that means so much for the show :)
@PandezPanda Yes, happy panda, I got so many cool pictures taken and printed through the air, haha.

Ok that last wish was stupid. Maybe I'll just stop being lazy and direct my autoposts correctly hah.
@brassgoogie lol!
@Magnitude_V1 thank you for supporting us!!
Wish: For Twitter, Instagram, Yelp and Tumblr (or Posterous) to merge into one unified ball of social awesomeness.

RT @Mynos: @feliciaday the first rule of strange hair growth club  is we do not talk about strange hair growth.
Ever find a weirdly long hair growing in a strange part of the body? Asking for a friend.

@LinhN I can't commit to either one, haha.  I push out to Tumblr through my Posterous, I dunno.  Posterous is more granular?
Lost it at Pac Man: ULTRA NEXTGEN AAA Sound Design http://t.co/f6cOzla (via @Ryon_D) Thank you for this ridiculous video biglionmusic.com!
#SXSWi I am in you!
@MichaelRando they wouldn't let me, something weird happened with the confirmation number :(
@dancrum they need to buy twitter, anything they build from the ground up will take too long to stick IMO.
@PeevedMichelle I'm getting a middle seat for sure :(
@jolly1976 some people stare and tweet instead of saying hi. I'd prefer them Say hi :)
OH: "I'm a budding entrepreneur", "My social media strategy is", "Let's exchange info!", "You bring the demos?" Yup, I'm on a plane to SXSW!
@lendleapp thank you!
RT @Jonolobster: @feliciaday The new format war will be whether we're known as our FB, Google, or Twitter IDs on the interwebs.
RT @gypsywoman35: @feliciaday I so totally agree about the FB "takeover" in regards to using separate sign ins. Thanx
@JoshuaJericho the are tools That are great as long as you drive them. Forcing you to make them identity is ridiculous.
