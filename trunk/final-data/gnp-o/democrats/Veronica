@jeffrubenstein Hah!!
@jeffrubenstein I'll try, where is it?
RT @lvdjgarcia: Daylight Savings Time; If you get a pic of @Veronica & @FeliciaDay together it means Summer comes early #SXSW
@levelmaker thanks!
@Donengene not gonna happen, we couldn't get in! /cc @anamariecox
@StevenSmithsays nooo I leave Tuesday!
@ameyapendse awww Iron Works is the best! Jealous!
Between the two hour time difference here in Austin and daylight saving, I just really hope I'm not late/early for everything tomorrow.
@escapist Frank is DA BEST.
@nick8539 Paul left weeks ago.
@joshuatopolsky @reckless You guys are the best, can't wait to see what you both have in store for the tech world.

@domster lol!!
@valandil211 I don't agree that anyone is "carelessly" ripping the roots, so I guess that's why we see it differently.
#endmalaria thanks @DFID_UK & @number10gov for your historic support for #malaria control and prevention! http://bit.ly/hizV9U

@DieLaughing I'm sorry.
@joebenitez so... everyone who uses a mac is automatically a "fanboy?" c'mon.
@AmberButane huh? I don't know what you're talking about. And you haven't recommended anything to me, that I can see.
Question for all of you suggesting Aperture: is it as easy to run on an external HD as iPhoto?
@NanoRiff I'm using that tool actually. Can't even open an old instance of iPhoto on an external drive. Lame.
Among everything else I have to do today, apparently I need to rebuild my entire iPhoto library. Remind me why I'm using iPhoto again?
@ejacqui high road ftw :)
@TreyRatcliff great photo! is it for Shadow of the Torturer?
@SethHWilson yup, almost done BSC. Love it, though it's pretty brutal, even for Abercrombie.
RT @GeorgeTakei: Today we are all Japanese.  Give $10 to help. Text REDCROSS to 90999, or click http://ow.ly/4ctzx   Pls RT!
@meettravis and thanks, I don't need to be reminded that this is a serious situation.
@meettravis I guess I didn't hear it that way.
@joshuatopolsky sorry, didn't mean to twitter-snap. Just really high strung right now :(
@Digigala I'm pretty sure that was a first hand account. But whatever.
@joshuatopolsky isn't it their jobs to sound calm in times of disaster? To report what's happening?
@aaronhimel please be safe.
@Hector_Ana7 8.9 earthquake.
RT @kristykorcz: Video of the #Japan #Tsunami is really scary. http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/
Wow, watching CNN right now. My thoughts are with everyone in Japan right now. Terrifying.

@Fee501st only bought the game last night! Haven't had a chance to start playing yet :( @phxhawke @dragonage
@phxhawke @fee501st Nope, I'm talking about the new @rdio app for Mac, it's not AIR based. The old app is though, and still works.
@escapist just got that email, so excited to try it out! /cc @uber @livestrong
@safesolvent yeah, except I'm filling it with all new music all the time, and paying a small subscription fee, instead of buying.
@kpereira yup.
I've now completely dumped iTunes for music on my MBP and iPhone. Going all @rdio for desktop app and mobile sync.
@missmarisol thanks lady!!
@0x13A it's always good to do a follow-up call or email!
