My coworker is talking to me about how Europe has had "millions of civil wars before it became a country."
I didn't even think: Final Destination vs. Fast and the Furious! Genius! How can I make money off of this concept? Thank you, Officer!!
So yes. It was my fault that another car span into mine like something outta Final Destination. Therefore I froze up-
Perhaps I could have activated my NOS and then just done a sick U-ie & went on my merry way. Sorry for ruining YOUR day with my non-driving.
Sorry Mr. Officer: I did not have Vin Diesel riding shotgun & didn't know I was supposed to reverse it down the freeway to avoid a crash.

@thatswrite Best tweet I have ever read: "Everything > Twilight."
Did they hear me rant about the ridiculousness of the situation? Do I destroy my room looking for a tape recorder that may not exist?
Starting to get really paranoid. Like, if my landlord came into my apartment to put a letter on my doorknob, did they also bug my room?
So now I'm getting sued by my landlord because they broke my lease. Epic.
