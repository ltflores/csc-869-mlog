@amandafrench me too. I really thought I'd get a chance to escape to see you all for a moment but it wasn't in the cards. Cheers Amanda!
@beng3 me too! If I only had an extra day. Hope you had fun!
@Tales I yelled out "hi!!!" Here in security line. Hungover people don't think its funny. I blamed you.
Airport bound w/ less than 3 hr's sleep and no, not because I was out partying. You'll see my hard work when TNT and TWiT video publish.
@just1nux yes! And that's how we finally got it figured out! I shoulda used a pizza box a lot earlier. :-)
@JonStrickland thanks for joining yesterday's TNT!!! Awesome hanging with ya.
@bigcrav @jeffjarvis hehehe... I *THINK* I am... but not by too much.
TWiT live from sxsw. My pov http://twitpic.com/499juv
@marquesstewart Awesome meeting you man!
@dhyvarinen its live!
Catch live streaming coverage of SXSW nightlife and parties in about an hour!! - Live.twit.tv - I'll be there... will YOU?
@MisterCardigan hey thanks for making my night man! Its not often I get an out-of-nowhere fan of the show saying hey! Dinner is deelish. :)
Admiral Adama at SXSW! Nerd snort http://twitpic.com/48wejf
Use Skype? Have a toddler that hits keys during a call messing everything up? Use this to lock the keyboard! http://macifier.com/
@Tales that would be awesome to see a Tales in person in Texas! Need to get you a cowboy hat.
@amandafrench I am hoping to stop by for a brief period after I leave to edit TWiT. Will say hi!
Actually, I'm not at all ashamed of my morning alarm song today: John Lennon "Isolation". It was just a general warning. :)
@amandafrench hey Amanda! I SO wish I could see you perform tomorrow night at the bol event! :/ knock em dead...ALL yer internet friends! K?
One must be careful when choosing the song that shall serve as their wake up alarm. That song shall be with you all. day. long.
The great "my dad on Facebook" experience is over. He couldn't handle knowing THAT much. At least he tried.
@starmike @eileentv I so wish I would have spotted you during the interview!! Good to see you afterwards though. :)
http://yfrog.com/h2wqjkhj ipad2 at sxsw. My pov.
Ipad2 line. My pov.
If we were live covering the Droid Bionic release instead of iPad 2, I'd buy one on site.
@MarkHeath believe me, if the bionic or the thunderbolt were actually available RIGHT NOW, I probably would!
Prepping for the Sunday show. #twit #sxsw
Desire to get a new phone rises significantly once I find myself at an event like SXSW. The Droid is old, slow and battery inefficient.
Depressing. According to this, I would have netted over $200k instead of having two now-pretty-much-dead computers. http://bit.ly/e3Mz4d
Apparently, having an extra leg room seat on JetBlue also gives you a priority pass through security! Score one for being tall!
@allen099 Thanks mah man! This trip will test my current Gingerbread BB rom running at low voltage 600Mhz. If my battery lasts, I win!
About to leave the house for the airport. Austin bound and happy about it!  See yall there!  #sxsw
@virgiliocorrado hi there!
@JoshuaCaleb75 Aww shucks. It gets easier with every episode, trust me. :)
@SusanDennis Yes, once it officially launches... and that should be shortly after SXSW. :)
@hockey_david @eileentv Has been Mondays or Tuesdays so far. Official day will probably be Mondays when it starts for real.
@Vance14 Congrats and great choice! FYI peteralfonso.com has a port of Gingerbread (plain) that is pretty awesome, very stable.
@AnttyC manage music/video? Or, if everything, just mount it as a disk and u have full SD file access.. email AAA@twit.tv w more details. :)
All About Android beta 6 is now posted to YouTube! http://youtu.be/vSim5XokwPE

@androslee allaboutandroidshow@gmail.com
.....ok. Foursquare users in general: Is there anything you like/dislike about the apps?
What are the things you like most about Foursquare for Android?
@Vance14 I feel like it did. Before BB I was running out of space on my SD, and once I switched over and move apps I had tons more actually.

.......WHO ARE YOU CALLIN' PSYCHO
Strange cause I love music. But I have never felt compelled in the slightest to even start a Ping acct. And I sign up for... anything!
Got the word that All About Android will be out of Beta and into Release Candidate soon! Like... a few weeks or so? :)
No? No Reanimator fans out there? A Reanimator PLAY!! Awesome!!! Nudge nudge
@nexusdrifter Call me crazy. Maybe I'd like it if I weren't such a fan of the plain old Strokes sound. Credit for trying something new.
Rad: http://bit.ly/gqyf1J #reanimator
