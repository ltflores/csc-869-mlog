@starmike sorry I had to run! When I get a break, i run to take it :)
Ok one rant about apple sxsw store - no free wifi!
Sorry for all the 4sq badge BS. Gotta turn those notifications off. Event feels so insignificant in light of what happened in Japan.
I'm at Apple Store, SXSW (522 Congress Ave, Congress Ave & West 6th, Austin) w/ 29 others http://4sq.com/dN4ynx
RT @GeorgeTakei: The devastation is heartbreaking, shocking: http://ow.ly/4cySX   Text REDCROSS to 90999 to give $10 today.
I just unlocked the "4sq Early Adopter" badge on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/gU8mk7
@jollyroger and @snubs got a hotel 3.3 miles away too. Phooey!
@Snubs @jollyroger holy crapola. I haven't received my email yet. Scared to get it!
Checking out our venue for Sunday night. Great space!  @ MoMo's http://instagr.am/p/CJIYY/
@nicole are you on the same flight as @raygun01?

@JonStrickland yes! Swing by. We'll be prepping by 4:30p. As a producer I hope for the madness :)
Whoa, got lots of email about the pop-up Apple store too. We'll probably go live on Friday at 5p CT from that location. Host is @shwood!
@jonfingas @missm I'm going to buy his iPad. We'll be live from austin showing the lines tomorrow!
@ccadenhead 6th and congress.

@MAQ_Ecosse eileen@twit.tv
Yes! Thanks to all for the tweets about this :) RT @MissM @eileentv Did you hear that apple is opening a store at SXSW? http://bit.ly/e5ozmK
@greenetech thanks! Genuine smiles from the both of us :)
Yo!  http://instagr.am/p/CH_Rf/
@biird I have an iPhone too.
@biird thanks for the tip!
@jollyroger you already got a confirmation email? I didn't :(
RT @Biteclubshow: New episode! With TVD in hiatus, we revisit Buffy Season 3 episodes 1-3. Plus we talk True Blood amnesia & shower scen ...
@derrickc82 it may just be me, but I will NEVER forgive sprint.
@therealpenelope good to see i'm not alone in the hate (I don't use that word lightly).
@Veronica oh no!
@frontline99 they are all evil, but I already have an iPhone/AT&T account. So I'd probably go Verizon with my Android.
@PhatEmoKid well, it's just a rumor -- for now.
@guapozx me too! That's why I've hated them for years.
As a current T-Mobile customer, this would make me sad. I can't stand Sprint. http://buswk.co/fFsKCJ
@Anelf3 get better and stay away from the cottage :)
@hockey_david @JayDyok  we are aiming for Monday evenings. 5p PST
And now, more waiting. Wonder if I'll get the hotel I want! #SDCC
@JayDyok cool! thank you!
@hockey_david we believe it's going to be Monday evenings. 5p PT/ 8p ET
Lovely morning ranking SDCC hotels for reservations. http://instagr.am/p/CHWYt/
Liking the new Foursquare. Had no idea I frequented French restaurants.  http://twitpic.com/47ppcv
Dear fellow Comic-Con 2011 attendees, may the force be with you during hotel reservations tomorrow morning!
@Medros bummer!
@dangerousdaven you're welcome!
@angingrich Thank you! We'll have you on again, for sure! That is, if you want to. @raygun01
@emailforhelp thank you. I felt a little off, but thanks!
@At0mXII yes on the Get Glue one.
We've also got limited edition stickers. Come to Momo's or find us roaming around and we'll give you one! http://bit.ly/ic3aYv #sxsw
@sarahlane oh no! @memolane looks like an awesome time suck. *covers eyes*
Fun promotion w/ @getglue! Check in on a TWiT show and redeem this sticker at our TWiT SXSW Meetup this Sunday! http://bit.ly/gBAwNW
@PretzelCrisps someone came up to the cottage yesterday and dropped off a ton of samples!
@JonStrickland mmmmmm donuts ;) I could use one right now.
@missmarisol Picture Show 3.0 has an awesome new update.
I think it's a bad sign that I'm already *over* all the new SXSW app launches (and the event hasn't started). #toomuchinfo
@Oakraidr @PhatEmoKid @kerotab @LoveMeDeux @RogueTess I've got too many stressful events during lent, so I'm going to pass too.
Although I love the British version, I'm starting to really like this one too. http://bit.ly/dQUJg0 (via @GetGlue) #BeingHumanUS
@PhatEmoKid i bet you *would* cry if you saw her live in concert!
