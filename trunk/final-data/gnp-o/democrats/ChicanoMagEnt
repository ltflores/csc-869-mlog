@Mcmex yes sir you couldn't be more correct, I will def get the word out as much as I can b/c voting is something I feel strongly about
@Mcmex For all but some say it to deter voters in minority groups http://t.co/hPueaRC
@Mcmex actually at least 1 from that list including the voter id card, sorry didn't have enough room to include the word "or", damn limit :/
@Mcmex pretty soon they're guna require birth certificates
@Mcmex lol sorry i didn't make myself clear oops :) I meant "us" here in TX. Hopefully this won't deter anyone from voting
@Mcmex when just a voter registration card was sufficient before, all to prevent "voter fraud", who knew it was such a big issue
To vote we will be required to present a driver license, TX ID card, military ID, concealed handgun license, passport, citizenship ID
@Mcmex I don't know if you've heard but they are trying to make it harder for voters to vote in TX, its a shame :(
@Mcmex recently seen a rise n more well-informedLatinos pero 4 the most part we r misinformed scared to speak up & think our votes dnt count
@Mcmex that's a great and important topic, after all this country is what it is today because of immigrants, msg me when u want to tweetup
