@Eric_Urbane I'd say, Too bad Gov can't see this!  Companies not seeing this means opportunities for other Comapnies who do.

@chrisheuer oh, and don't forget that her opponent couldn't name the 5 freedoms granted under the 1st Amendment, funny no mention of that???
@chrisheuer ran by local Govs and communities.
@chrisheuer it says "Congress shall make NO law" the court says that the Congress passed 1st amend allows banning of expression at school
@chrisheuer and I find it funny that you always ignore the other part "preventing the free expression"
@chrisheuer it was a court ruling that coined that term!  And separation is a lot different than establishment <---  part of 1st Amend
@chrisheuer Quite the opposite! There is in fact NO mention of separation of church and state in the 1st amendment!

@GuyKawasaki and re supply the under the table workers!
@GuyKawasaki think business opposes amnesty?? No, floods market with more labor and price of labor drops and with no enforcement more come.
@GuyKawasaki Big businesses more in line W/ DEM immigration policy than ours!  Dems are enablers of illegal immigrant labor $ exploitation!
@GuyKawasaki when you grant amnesty they will be replaced by the next inflow who will then undercut their ability to earn decent pay!
@GuyKawasaki immigrant labor you say?? We are all for going after businesses who hire illegals, doing nothing about illegals makes it worse
@GuyKawasaki 170K would pay for my entire health care policy for 20 years let alone 18% of 40 or 50 years earnings!

@globalnewsman hoping to prevent from ever reaching the big nomination.
@globalnewsman Lower courts are less newsworthy and is where they have historically taken stands and blocked those they don't like most.
@globalnewsman then Dems were first to block an appellate court nominee under Bush which happened 2 be the more than well qualified Hispanic
@globalnewsman Dems broke with tradition on Supreme Court nominees in 80s when they blocked Bork creating the term "Borked"!
@globalnewsman and yes, there were more than a hundred prevented from getting votes resulting in record vacancies on the courts.
@globalnewsman traditionally decorum had been that Presidents get their nominees especially for the big ones!  Endless battle of paybacks!
@DEDLINES to me, that is liberalism! To each his own but when you try to raise my kid using the Gov then I have issues!
@DEDLINES and on social issues, so what if repubs don't want gov giving kids condoms!  I can care less if you give your kid condoms!
@DEDLINES Dems only liberal on social issues, they are nothing of the sort on ANYTHING else!  They are control freaks!
@DEDLINES It was also a Repub Pres who put affirmative action into place through executive order! Need to get your facts straight!
@DEDLINES it was Dem Govs who instituted Jim Crow laws and  opposed de segregation!  It was Repub Pres who went out national Guard!
