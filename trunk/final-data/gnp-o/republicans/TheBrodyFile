I would love to watch a one on one primary discussion between @chrischristie and @donaldtrump. Man talk about straight up talk.
@chrischristie comes across as a breath of fresh air not hot air
the magic of @chrischristie is that you never know what he is going to say. He is doing political standup. You're waiting for next big line
the magic of @chrischristienis that you never know what he is going to say. He is doing political standup. You're waiting for next big line
@chrischristie doing standup comedy at AEI.  says he will probably have to commit suicide to convince people he's not running in 2012
@chrischristie gets standing ovation after speech. now comes q and a. this should be interesting...
@chrischristie talking new jersey politics but also with many references to America and americans...hmmm...2012? door slightly ajar?
@chrischristie showing that he can talk substance and be entertaining. few politicians can do that
@chrischristie says it's time for blunt and direct talk
after his blunt AEI speech, will be interesting to see if there becomes even more of  groundswell to get @chrischristie to run in 2012
@chrischristie defining himself the guy who is going to go around and tell everybody the "dirty little secret in the room"
@chrischristie comes across as fresh because he sounds like a regular guy that would shop at walmart.
@chrischristie says obama giving american people candy of american politics. high rail and high speed internet is political candy
@chrischristie says he;s worried about what's happening in wash dc right now
@chrischristie coming across as regular guy in speech. he stole line from brodyfile when he said "here's the deal"

@chrischristie blasting dems in speech.
inside AEI watching @chrischristie deliver his big speech.
