@ChairmanLisa I probably won't because the new job will have just started.
@patmelton I agree. But it's absurd that a group would withdraw because another group is part. No 1 issue should lead to such division
@rightohio Thanks. I really appreciate the heads up on that.
@rightohio You're about as much a part of the vast right wing conspiracy as I'm part of the New England Patriots football team.
The reality @ohiobrian is that @rightohio is just jealous of my total brilliance. Isn't that right Matthew?
@rightohio For once, we agree.
@OhioBrian haha
@rightohio I didn't say you said that, I said you contend that you have to be a 100% friend.
Despite what @rightohio might content, as conservatives we need to stick together on what we agree on and be respectful on our differences.
It's their decision, but it's sad that some conservative groups are skipping CPAC because of the inclusion of GOProud. http://bit.ly/e06BeJ
