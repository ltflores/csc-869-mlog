Freezing this morning. Hot this afternoon. Man, Florida weather will give you sartorial whiplash!
Started my "Week of Tardiness" by being late to Mass. Thanks a lot Daylight Saving Time! #fail
I seriously, strongly dislike "springing forward." Now I will commence being late to everything for a week. #fail
@JonnyTorres Yep. Made me never want to eat again!
Great. More Chinese chicken. RT DailyDeadline: Sweetbay to beat prices at Walmart, Target, Aldi on 500+ items: http://tbo.ly/eUwelO
When I can't remember the words to a song, I make up new lyrics that are more interesting...to me. #lol
Lunch? Takee Outee left overs.
I'm hungry.
I love Weezer.
A dozen long stem red roses and a heart-shaped box were just delivered to me. Matt is the bestest. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!
Made Moroccan couscous for dinner. The raisins were a surprisingly tasty garnish.
We'd like you to have this flower from the Church of Religious Consciousness. Would you like to make a donation?"
Airplane is on CMT! "What do you make of this?" "I can make a hat. I can make a brooch..."
Someone should combine #MMA and #football: non-stop action between quarters, no standing around and blood. THAT would be worth watching.
RT @Smalltalkwitht: True Love RT @IndyPiggy: I would rather watch my hubby scratch his ass than this halftime show #superbowl
I'm not watching the #SuperBowl- not even for the commercials- until they make #football more interesting.

I'm at Jump Zone AKA Hell.
My favorite name of the #mafia members nabbed by the #FBI? Vinny Carwash. How does one get an awesome name like that?
I love designing trade show booth graphics. It's like painting a mural only easier and with less drama.
Gooooood morning! And Happy Hump Day! It's all down hill from here...

Woke up with "Log" stuck it my head. WTH? Guess it's better than bad -it's good. Thanks Ren & Stimpy. #stupid
People love #Oprah because she ate 30 lbs of mac & cheese? Eew!
I don't understand #Panera Bread. The food isn't that good, but you can never find a table and the line to order wraps around the building.
I agree 100%. #Palin: Critics create 'blood libel' after Tucson shooting - Politics - More politics - msnbc.com http://t.co/hqbg7xb

@richellecarey re: tuition. Ridiculous! It's reverse discrimination. What's next? Not allowing wealthier students 2 apply for scholarships?

Headed to the City on a shopping excursion. I understand there's an awesome shoe sale at Saks. Woo hoo!
On @politico, Pelosi says, "Every minute is a new minute to me." Isn't it to everyone? It's called "time." Thanks, Captain #Obvious.
So, do we have to pass the gavel to see what's in it? #pelosi
