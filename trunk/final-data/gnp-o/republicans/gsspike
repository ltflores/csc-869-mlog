@NAACP The tea party is about taxes and a government that listens to the voters!

@NAACP Funny how this is released just before the election!  Your are playing games.
@NAACP There are racist in the Dem party too?  Why do you support them?  Besides it's a lie.  All racist are asked to leave!!!!!!!!!!!!
