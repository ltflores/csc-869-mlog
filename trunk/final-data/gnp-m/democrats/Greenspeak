@seanmolloy you know why you keep missing them, Molloy? Cuz you're lollygagging!
@VivasKaul @MattBodega Yes, that was The First Kerfuffle this week.
@BoutonBrian I would so totally eat Cheesy Kerfuffles.
@evil_avatar Yeah, I don't really care either way about the actual content of the story. I'm mostly interested in the word "kerfuffle" :)
@zackjewell I think it's like the Supreme Court definition of pr0n:  We know it when we see it.
@angelfan91 Ya know, if you say that in a certain way, I could take that as you flirting with me.
@TurboToaster @MattBodega LOL :)
Okay, consensus seems to be that this is not a kerfuffle. I, for one, am relieved. We need to save that word for when it's really needed.
@MattBodega the first was the earlier bitch fight over a Brink review...
Gang, how are we classifying today's Kotaku/MW3 thing? Is it another kerfuffle? Cuz that'd make two kerfuffles in one week. #kerfuffles
@InvadedSpace Well, we've TALKED about it. That's some progress!
@DarthWaya lol :D
@ChaseClark haha.  :)  Those have both been in my collection since the day they came out.
@datarez more grunge/punk stuff.  Guns N Roses were suspiciously "metal" for me back then. I've since seen the light.
Shameful confession time: I have never owned Guns N Roses' Appetite for Destruction. I just rectified that error. Please forgive me.
