House passed Pelosi's govt takeover of healthcare 220-215.  39 bipartisan Dems joined myself and all but 1 Republican voting against.

A moment of silence now on the House floor.
Appears to be a coordinated attack against our military.  Whether directed from a foreign or domestic source it is still an act of terror.
