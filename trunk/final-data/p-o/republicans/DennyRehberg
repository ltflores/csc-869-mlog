Montana has just about every type of energy. Oil, gas, coal, wind, solar, biomass, hydro. Let’s leverage that to create #jobs. #USEnergy #MT
Raising taxes on oil only impacts domestic energy production, giving foreign oil an advantage and destroying #jobs #USEnergy #MT #gasprices
Some in Congress think the answer to our energy crisis is to ride a bike or use a subway. They’ve never been to Montana in Winter #USEnergy
High gas prices depress economic activity. We need a comprehensive energy plan that increases supply & improves conservation #USEnergy #gas
We can create ‘green jobs’ without destroying existing #jobs in the #energy industries. #USEnergy #gas #gasprices #economy #tcot #mt

Just wrapped up Listening Sessions 76 & 77; Great input from hundreds of concerned Montanans. Please share your thoughts, ideas & concerns.
Just visited very exciting Missoula start-up whocanhelp.com. They're keeping MT talent in the state and creating new jobs. #MTJobs #MT
Toured Missoula tech company Rivertop Renewables today and talked chemicals, technology, and their bright future in Montana. #MTJobs #MT

Terrific talk on health care with the docs and staff of the Orthopedic Center of MT. Nothing like getting a first-hand perspective. #MTJobs
10th year of talking to the MT Rural Water Systems Conference in GF! Lots of friendly faces and am reminded of all they do for rural #MT.
Stopped by Avmax yesterday in Great Falls to talk airplanes. They're adding a lot of jobs and boosting the economy. #MTJobs
Always so impressed with the men & women of the MT Air Nat'l Guard in GF. Important to highlight their good work and keep the F-15s. #MTJobs

Great conversation with WWC Engineering in Helena on some of our biggest natural resource issues. Biggest takeaway? Less regulation! #MTJobs
Always nice talking with the folks at Marks Lumber in Clancy. Lots of ideas on how we can cut the deficit and prioritize spending. #MTJobs
Just visited Boeing in Helena to receive nat'l assn of manufacturers award. Good people doing great work and creating Montana jobs. #MTJobs
Impressed with the people and products at Schnees in Bozeman. Great visit, lots of discussion about regulation and health care. #MTJobs
Day 1 of my Jobs Tour and already created a job. Sen. Tester has hired someone to film me.
Great visit earlier today with Bozeman Chamber member companies. Good talk on economic development, health care, finance. #MTJobs #MT

Yes we can! Change the direction in Washington.
There are more good ideas and worthy projects than we have the money to fund.  It’s past time for spending reform. #mt #tcot
Critics said ending earmarks wouldn’t save money. They were wrong. I saved $1 billion plus in my bill alone by rescinding $ for earmarks.
@GerriWillisFBN, Going to be on The Willis Report with Gerri Willis on Fox Business Network sometime around 3 pm.  Tune in!
As we debate painful budget cuts, ask yourself if there better ways to spend tax dollars than on stimulus road signs. The answer is yes.
Every dollar the Fed Gov’t spends has an advocate, but I’m here to be the advocate for the struggling taxpayer who says enough is enough.
Saving $1 in the federal budget is harder than spending $100. But Montanans didn’t send me to Washington to do the easy thing.

The #MTLeg wants to let Montanans decide if the feds should force us to buy health insurance. http://tinyurl.com/45tuc8x How would YOU vote?
The thoughts and prayers of all Montanans are with @CBSNews correspondent Lara Logan. This kind of thing should never happen.
House GOP is trying to save taxpayers $100 billion. The same Dems who blew 10X that on the failed stimulus are fighting it tooth and nail.
Watch C-SPAN to see how YOU changed Congress!  We’re debating how much to REDUCE spending, not how much to INCREASE it.
If you can, watch C-SPAN. The 2011 Spending Bill is on floor with an “open rule” allowing unlimited amendments. This is open government.

Bipartisan seating at the State of the Union was a big hit in the press. Imagine how great it would have been for Obamacare negotiations.
As long as #Obamacare is still in place, nothing can save our health care system. That's why we must #repeal and start over together. #SOTU
President Obama asked members of Congress to put their public schedules online.  Montanans know I've been doing that for years. #SOTU
Yes, we need a new energy policy - but not one where Washington D.C. picks winners and losers. We need all options on the table. #SOTU
Actions speak louder than words: If we're going to tackle illegal immigration, let's start by ending the lawsuit against Arizona. #SOTU
Raising taxes on gas when prices have already blown through $3/gallon isn't the answer. Let's not kill one industry to build the next. #SOTU
Unfortunately, #SOTU focused on same government "solutions" that were tried and failed. American's don't need gov't to solve our problems.
While everyone can agree with many of the words in the #SOTU, words are cheap. Actions are better.  Voters will judge actions, not words.

#Obamacare temporary tax credits for businesses are reduced with new hires and more payroll - penalizing creation of #jobs and higher wages!
Medicare Trustees say #Obamacare will cause 5.8 million seniors to lose current retiree prescription drug coverage by 2016. #Repeal, replace
Dozens of GOP reform bills were offered, all completely ignored in secret #Obamacare deal. #Repeal, replace with bipartisan solutions. #mt
Millions of Americans were completely shut out of #Obamacare debate – #Repeal, replace with real bipartisan solutions. #mt #tcot #hcr
#Obamacare budget gimmick gives us only 6 years of benefits after 10 years of taxes.  True cost after fully implemented is $2.6 Trillion.
With near two-digit #unemployment already, @NFIB business study shows the #Obamacare employer mandates will destroy 1.6 million #jobs
There’s still time.  Repealing #Obamacare means stopping government takeover that will only increase cost of care before it happens.
CBO estimates your insurance rates will increase $2,100 in next 5 years because of #Obamacare.  We need to focus on costs. #MT #tcot #hcr
#Obamacare takes more than $500B from Medicare to create new entitlements our country can’t afford.  That’s why I support repeal, replace.
I just voted to repeal #Obamacare. Will Senators Baucus & Tester vote with Montanans or support Reid's filibuster in the Senate? #MT #tcot
Montanans didn’t want #Obamacare when it passed and they want it even less now. This government should work for us, not against us. #MT
I was the only member of Montana’s delegation to hold listening sessions on #Obamacare and the only one to vote against it. Coincidence? #MT
Montanans join Jan and I in praying for Rep. Giffords as she’s released from the hospital.  This is great news, hoping for full recovery.
Please join me in welcoming & following my friend @RepShelley Moore Capito (R-WV)
Since #Obamacare passed Montana’s insurance premiums have gone up.  Isn’t that making healthcare the opposite of “affordable”?
Some are claiming that repealing huge government expansion in the #Obamacare law will actually increase the deficit.  Do you believe them?
Montana needs jobs, but #Obamacare is costing jobs as employers remain hesitant to hire in face of unknown federal regulations.
RT @SpeakerBoehner Priorities of the People: Repealing ObamaCare Critical to Creating Jobs, Growing Economy http://is.gd/w56w2N
Policy aside, if gov't derives power from the consent of the people, isn't broad public opposition reason enough to repeal a law?
I know the people of Montana join Jan and I in prayers for my friend Rep. Giffords, her staff and constituents and their families.

Just because I don’t support an #earmark for a project doesn’t mean I don’t support that project. Montanans get that. Wish our Senators did.
There are more projects and ideas that I support than we can afford. Montanans get that. They support the #earmark ban.
Defending the #earmark establishment is not leadership. Defending business-as-usual in Washington isn’t either. Leaders lead by example.
I asked: “Do you support reduced fed spending even if it means MT will get less money from the fed gov’t?” 91% (3,450) said YES. #earmark
