@wajobu have a great rest of the weekend and great tweeting with you
@wajobu we're probably at different places on the political spectrum, but i hope we can work together on #jobs/americanjobcreators.com

@Visigoth5157 that's why we're doing this.  thank you for the message and stay in touch.
@CaroleODell would you be willing to share how?  we need to hear from you at AmericanJobCreators.com. it takes 5 minutes and i appreciate it
@5sahandful if you missed it, here's the great work by Team Oversight on #SEC management failures: http://youtu.be/haloSaAJ3Xw
@5sahandful did you see Team Oversight's tough hearing getting to the bottom of SEC myriad management failures?
@wajobu i hope you'll at least keep an eye on our work at AmericanJobCreators.com & help where you can, ask tough ?s where you can't. deal?
@wajobu i see where you're coming from and understand your skepticism.  all i can do is share what we're doing, why and deliver results
@wajobu government does not do that today: understand real impact of its actions, back it up with facts, and answer "is this worth it?"
@wajobu and that's what we need to know: which taxes? which regulations? then we use hard data to balance cost vs benefit
@wajobu which is, sadly, the hard-working #smallbusiness men and women of America.  We must hear their challenges to fix what's unecessary
@wajobu can you at least give us the benefit of the doubt? we're trying to bring everyone into the conversation, especially those not heard
@wajobu part of that problem is there's no way to listen to #smallbusiness effectively.  that's where americanjobcreators.com comes in.
@wajobu some are from corporations, many (if not most) are from #smallbusiness, that creates most jobs and opportunity in america
@wajobu fact is, you can't tell me what #regulations are necessary and what aren't based on data.  can any one? that's why we are asking
@wajobu how so? all we're asking is what #regulations hold back job creators from one woman startups on up
@wajobu you aren't addressing my point...do you think what we're doing makes sense?
@wajobu but when gov't regulates everything, it regulates nothing effectively or efficiently (see: #oilspill, housing collapse)
@wajobu i don't disagree with you...Team Oversight was on folks who let #Oilspill happen years ago. same w/ fannie/freddie's regulator
@wajobu gov't doesn't understand it's impact, though, on workers/families/businesses.  we must change that: americanjobcreators.com
@wajobu that's why we need your help at AmericanJobCreators.com.  We need hard data on what regs help and hurt to target our work.
@wajobu some regs are necessary. some are not. can you tell the difference?
@DCdoozy hope i don't fall into that category...thanks for the the thank you
