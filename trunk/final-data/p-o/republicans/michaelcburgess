So sorry for the tardiness of this update. The "stop-doggett" amendment passed. TX schools win one. On to the Senate.
Soon to do an amendment to strike the "Doggett Language" that prevents TX from receiving education funds.
Soon I will be offering an amendment to de-fund a new Fed Agency, CCIIO, which is driving the implementation of ObamaCare.
US House continues to plow through amendments to the CR- to fund the gov't to next Oct.

At last. On an AA MD80 back to DFW. 7pm Hurst TownHall will work out after all. But I will be getting a headstart on "casual Friday".
Still trying to make it back for Hurst Townhall.

But could we just once talk about victory in Iraq, and not just ending the war there. Our troops' sacrifice provided that victory.
And yes, I agree there is no more honorable profession than a Teacher.
Speaking of last year, very little time devoted #hcr. We agree on improvements to our Med/Liability system, but would like to see the plan.
Mood seemed more subdued tonight than last year. President less combative, House polite, but hardly enthusiastic.
Hit the wrong button- observations before or after.
Gathering on the House floor for SOTU. No tweets during speech. But maybe a few obsevatiins
