Just finished tele townhall mtg with 8,000 residents-90% on the call supported my "no" vote on health care reform. Thanks for your input!
Just voted no on Democrat takeover of health care. Will continue to voice my strong opposition to ObamaCare.
Obama, Pelosi still insist on ramming health care takeover through Congress. This big govt. plan wrong for Florida, wrong for nation.
Dems want to gamble with one-sixth of the U.S. economy with their health care plan. Americans reject it, so do I. Go to crenshaw.house.gov.
Pelosi and Obama want to take over heath care and raise your taxes. Didn't support their plan last fall and will vote against it again.
CBO: Dem health care plan costs $1 tillion, raises taxes, cuts Medicare, hikes insurance. GOP plan provides more access to affordable care.
In Nancy Pelosi’s alternative universe, House doesn’t need to vote on healthcare reform to pass it. Read WSJ OP-ED at http://bit.ly/cwBHYN
With another healthcare vote soon, House GOP plan meets the president's goals for reform, without a government takeover of health care.
