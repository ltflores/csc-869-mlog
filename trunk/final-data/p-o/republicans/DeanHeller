According to SBA, the cost of complying with the tax code is 66 percent higher for small businesses than for large businesses.
Tax compliance is already a major expense for small biz. 1099 requirement will substantially increase these costs.
1099 requirement discourages small businesses from hiring new workers. We cannot afford to slow job creation.
1099 requirement will hit small businesses hard, forcing them to redirect resources to the IRS instead of adding jobs.
The House will vote to repeal 1099 tax provision from HC law today. This provision will stifle growth if it is not repealed.
Only 47 members of the House voted for every spending cut during the FY 11 funding debate.  http://ow.ly/42QeS
Compliance for fed regs cost a small business of 20 employees or less approx $10,585 per employee. #tcot
Small Biz Admin estimates cost of federal regulations to the economy is $1.75 trillion which could be dedicated to job creation. #tcot
Today the House will vote to review all federal agency regulations that impede job creation. #tcot
This government has been on a massive spending spree and it is time for this reckless behavior to end. http://ow.ly/3K3BR
Many promises have been made by proponents of the health care law that have proven to be untrue. http://ow.ly/3GONq
Repealing the HC bill would help more Nevada employers and their workers keep the insurance they currently enjoy. http://ow.ly/3GJGx
If you like your insurance, you can keep it? HC law could force as many as 87 million Americans to lose their current health coverage.
Deficit reduction? The HC law taxes for 10 yrs to pay for 6 yrs of service. It will add trillions of dollars to existing federal liabilities
HC repeal today. According to the Administration, the federal gov't will spend $310 billion more under HC law than we would have without it.
Vote to repeal the job-killing healthcare law tomorrow. HC law included nearly $570 billion in tax increases that will hurt job creation.

Voting to repeal individual mandate in HC law.  The IRS shouldn't be involved in healthcare. #tcot
Dems should join House GOP with earmarks ban for a year. H.Res.1289 would ban earmarks for a year and reduce federal spending. #tcot
The Administration’s own actuaries found the healthcare bill will increase costs by $311 billion over the next decade. http://ow.ly/1DIk8
Latest NV unemployment rate is13.4%, well above the national rate. Stimulus is clearly not working. Congress needs to focus on jobs. #tcot
Of the $670b in tax increases enacted since Jan '09, $316b impact middle class families violating the President's tax pledge. #tcot

April 15, 2010 - tax day.  Since President Obama has taken office, Congress has raised more than $670b in taxes.
I just voted no on the government takeover of healthcare. #tcot
A total of $569.2B in tax increases in the healthcare package. It will kill jobs at a time when NV unemployment is 13%. #tcot
With all this "deeming" what's next...Amnesty? #tcot
Dems “deemed” a debt limit increase, Now they’re planning to “deem” #hcr. “Deeming” is costing Americans a lot of money. #tcot
Word on the Hill is Dems don't have the votes yet. Its boiling down to public funding for abortion in the Healthcare bill. #tcot
The W&M Committee is working on a new jobs bill that increases taxes. I thought the stimulus was supposed to solve our economic problems.
Eliminating earmarks will not erase our debt over night, but it is a step in the right direction.
House GOP votes to eliminate earmarks.  I was one of the first to sign Rep. Flakes petition requesting the vote.#tcot
Congress should lead by example and cut wasteful spending. We can start with our own operating costs. http://bit.ly/9dhiQP#tcot

OMB Director Peter Orszag is about to testify on the Presidents $3.8 trillion budget. #tcot
The federal government as grown by 15% since 2007. The FY 11 budget continues this trend increasing the debt.#tcot
Geithner discussing the importance of infrastructure. Less than 6% of the stimulus was dedicated to public infrastructure. #tcot
Since taking office, the President has increased gov't spending by 84% in non-defense discretionary spending over two years. #tcot
Geithner is talking about deficits. The 2010 deficit is projected to be $1.6 trillion. This is based upon the President's budget.#tcot#gop
President's budget increases taxes by more than $2 trillion.  How is this supposed to create jobs? #tcot#gop
The President's $3.8 trillion budget is more spending, more barrowing, more taxes, more deficits, and more debt.#tcot
Orszag and Geithner are going to tesitfy before W&M today to justify the President's $3.8 Trillion budget.  It triples the national debt.
I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Geithner opposing Chrysler use of taxpayer bailout funds to advertise during the Super Bowl. #tcot
Going to speak on the House floor on the debt limit increase shortly.
Bailout funds are going to be used for second stimulus.  If paid off today, interest on bailout money would cost Americans $141 billion.
First stimulus cost $250K per job “saved or created.” Growing the federal government will not turn our economy around.#tcot
The new stimulus is another missed opportunity to help Americans get back to work and another example of the disconnect in Washington.
Not a single hearing was held on new stimulus. No input by the states such as Nevada which have been most affected by economic downturn.
Second stimulus is a repeat of the first. Nation is at 10% unemployment, Nevada at 13% unemployment. First stimulus did not work.#tcot
Second stimulus will be voted on today. Congress has spent months on health care, but will only dedicate a day to economic recovery. #tcot
I offered a second motion to allow death tax to expire beyond next year.  It was defeated on a party line vote.
I offered a motion to permanently repeal the death tax.  Dems rejected on procedural grounds.
A full repeal of the death tax will create jobs and expand investment.  Congress should stop adopting policies that hurt economic recovery.
In 2001, Congress promised to repeal the death tax.  Congress should keep a promise for once. #tcot
Death tax has a negative impact on family farms, ranches and small businesses which are often passed down from one generation to the next.
The death tax bill is nothing more than a preemptive tax increase to prevent the expiration of the death tax next year. #tcot
Today’s death tax bill permanently sets the estate tax at 45%.  Congress should permanently repeal this tax. #tcot
Happy Thanksgiving.
