@alisonstorm That IS impressive. I understand you did a quite creative moped adventure for charity, too.
And moved by awareness of district's loss of seniority. As he said to the 10, "Keep a guy who's got a track record of conservatism!"
Just got a call from a friend who moved 10 votes just this morning from Gowdy to Inglis--moved by my opposition to Union lake earmark and

@briansikma My pleasure. Thank you for connecting, too!
@crismattoon Thank you that your encouragement and #followfriday recommendation.
@EricLykins Thank you!
Right now, we're understandably focused on opposing. I want to win the majority & get to proposing. Some Rs will find it hard to transition
So if we take the majority, we'd better have some folks who have plans and who can warmly sell those plans by capturing hearts and minds.
While in the minority it's largely about opposing the D agenda. If we take  the majority, the job changes to proposing rather than opposing.
Interesting conversation tonight with a tea party organizer. We talked about how job description will change if the GOP takes control.
@jvance325 You have a good point there, and that's something I'm working on.  Thank you for connecting.

Maybe then we'd be willing to charge and fall on the hill making hard decisions to stop our nation's bankruptcy. "Just doing my job, sir."
America's best are trained to be replaceable. Members of Congress should see themselves as replaceable.
Drawing inspiration from America's best in Iraq and Afghanistan. Try to compliment one of the and you'll hear, "Just doing my job, sir."

We've got to be bold! We've got to say "NO!" to $150 million recreational lakes. And we've got to be ready to explain entitlement reform.
Solutions or scapegoats? You get to choose today. We can STOP THE SPENDING with a bold plan like Paul Ryan's Roadmap for America's future.
Read all about pork, earmarks, the Union lake and fishing for votes:  http://wurl.ws/y6OQ
Little Pigs. Little pork. Little earmark for a recreational lake. No go with one lady: "When you get to your credit limit STOP THE SPENDING!
Just left Little Pigs' new location in Greer. Union Lake was main topic. Folks were fired up--ready to STOP THE SPENDING.
Also heard encouragement as to my voting record and discernment that we don't want to throw out those who have worked to balance the budget.
Great door-to-door in Augusta Circle area just now. Found enthusiastic response and got out lots of signs. "Stop the spending!" is the word!
Everyone: Stop the spending!
Really great door-to-door conversations in Greer just now. James: grow the jobs. Mark: find solutions. Bill: secure the border.
Very encouraging that people seem to be deciding to keep in office those who are prepared to stop the spending & a voting record to prove it
Just finishing door-to-door in Botany Woods in Greenville. Rain delayed the action for awhile, but then some very encouraging conversations
Originally from Ghana and living in NYC, he joined the Marines after 9/11. Became US citizen after second deployment. Wow, what an American!
As always happens at these events, I wish that he had spoken an I had listened. He was deployed 4 times to Iraq. Lost his right eye in 4th.
Spoke at two great Memorial Day events today. After the event at Greenville County Square a former Marine thanked me for speaking.
Mr. Joe Hudson died 3 years ago. "We were very close," Mrs. Hudson told me. "He went through a lot." On Memorial Day remember Joe Hudson.
Came home. No hospital beds. Had to wait. Recovered somewhat. Worked @ Steele Heddle for a time. Never quite well. Married 64 years.
Joe Hudson went in @ Normandy. Made it into countryside before being shot in chest and legs. Six ribs gone, medics covered heart with skin.
Just heard an inspiring account of love and devotion as I was going door-to-door off Parkins Mill Road in Greenville from Mrs. Joe Hudson.
Sadly, the other R and the D acknowledged that inaction takes us to Greece. We deserve better. We deserve a Congress ready to lead.
I asked if they (the other R and the D) were ready to cast votes and lead to solutions. "Heck no!" came the answer, "We'd lose our seats."
Amazed by what another R & a D told me in conversation on Floor. All agreed that people are mad. All agreed that big decisions must be made.
It's going to take more than 1200 to secure the border. We should get on with it. That's the first step in restoring the rule of law.
Glad that Pres. Obama will send 1200 troops to border. We can thank Arizona for re-starting a push that should never have stopped.
To see some beautiful girls (they got their Mom's looks and abilities) on a TV commercial, take a look at this: http://wurl.ws/tA0P
Health care reform should start with tort reform. If you're not clear about that, you shouldn't represent this district in Washington.
Meanwhile, I've voted for caps & support an even more sweeping proposal that I learned from SRHS on my 75-stop/9 month health care tour.
Ya think that lawyer cash might keep Gowdy from answering the Medical Society's question about tort reform? Got the garbled answer on tape!
Gowdy has raised $75,000 from lawyers (19% of his campaign cash). See  http://www.opensecrets.org/races/sectors.php?cycle=2010&id=SC04
Ironic that just next door is "The Lawyers Building" which houses some trial lawyers. Lo and behold there's a "Gowdy" sign out front!
Just met (in front of Greenville County Medical Society) with physicians who heard Trey Gowdy's non-answer on tort reform last Tuesday night
And the chances of me being for a $150 million earmark for a recreational lake? Zero.
Not my style to build false hope. Better to be straight up and tell folks the truth: Union lake can only be built with an earmark.
I admit to not fitting in w/ Washington-style politics: Build false hope in a "competitive grant" process for a "public private partnership"
No, I researched the proposed Lake w/ the Corps of Engineers and they told me bluntly: we will build the lake only if forced by an earmark
If it were simply a public/private partnership seeking a competitive grant for a 5,700 acre recreational lake, why would I have opposed it?
It's time to take a look at all that trial lawyer money Trey's gotten. It's time to ask why those trial lawyers are investing so heavily.
Gowdy didn't get away with the non-answer on tort reform tonight. The doctors were onto him. They heard a non-answer & talked to me about it
Amazing that Trey just had another chance to turn his tort reform lecture into a position, but he didn't.
