@autismtymz2 I completely agree with you - doing my best to fight Republican attacks on science, including NOAA.

RT @mardod: RT @nealrauhauser: @Spedwybabs if #AskDems was a contest I'd say @RepJimMcDermott pretty much carried the day. // #wadem
#AskDems was an educational experience. Also fun. Thanks to all who participated.
@DearCitizenTV Our country was founded on concept of common good -- i.e. helping our neighbors. Nobody made it in frontier by themselves.
.@runedart The venture capitalists can raise money but banks won't give loans without loan guarantees #askdems
.@nbonnem Republicans have their budget priorities backwards. Education is our future, not war. War research $$ are a waste #askdems
.@martian_mandi every industrialized country has figured out how to cover health needs for their people. We have no excuse. #askdems
.@mardod Start by nixing subsides for Big Oil and reinstating loan guarantees for alternative energy. #askdems
.@bettjay Absolutely. Like Willy Sutton said, I rob banks because that is where the money is. #askdems
.@drst like you, I'm fearful there won't be.
.@konquererz Has to be the bottomline - we can't backdown otherwise there is no future. Cutting safety net doesn't make us safer, save money
.@runedart only with tax reform aimed at the common good not the 1% at the top. #askdems
. @1SupremeGoddess  Lets start with defense spending. We spend more than the rest of the world on wasteful wars. #askdems
.@byeagle37 Recession is over for Wall Street. But no jobs for every Americans, but Wall Street not looking out the window. #askdems
.@misslexi9162 A civil society must have a corp of public workers -- abusing them doesn't save money. #askdems
.@tspj22 we need to raise revenue and I support the president's commitment to ending the cuts in 2012. #AskDems
@SouthernUTWild Its one of my greatest fears - neglect of our national treasures will be a loss our children.  #askdems

@sharonls09  Its not just a rhetorical statement that children are our future. Waste, fraud and abuse in Govt… (cont) http://deck.ly/~IyaoV
@DarrellIssa perhaps removing the tax cuts for the rich should be the type of tightening we should do. #askdems
@wcgirl1 Poor people aren't organized & don't give to political campaigns. That's why I support public financing of campaigns #askdems
@RL_Miller  Push alternative energy development.  Repubs to take away loan guarantees are short-sighted and counterproductive #askdems
@josephklewis  Another thoughtless cut.  Get a passport and look around the world. #askdems
@SandiBehrns Check my website (http://bit.ly/fZYhcO).  I've been saying that for weeks.  #askdems
@lizzicampbell  These aren't minor concessions when 25% of US kids live in poverty. Access to birth control isn't a minor issue.  #askdems
