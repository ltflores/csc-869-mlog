She said cuts to community health centers would put increased pressure on state and local budgets and would harm the health of the nation
Just questioned HHS Sec Sebelius on the impact draconian cuts Rs are trying to make to community health centers would have on the nation
The #WI budget repair bill potentially would eliminate insurance coverage for 63,000 parents and 6,800 adults
Gov Walker’s budget bill would not only strip workers of their rights, it also would gut WI's Medicaid program #WI

@hobbular @amandarose rather than focusing on creating jobs, the GOP is focused on taking away women’s rights http://tinyurl.com/4m47dvn

My thoughts and prayers lie with Gabby, her husband, all the victims of this tragedy and their families.
I am shocked and saddened beyond words by the horrific shooting of my colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, members of her staff, and others
I will take to the House floor to share your stories so the nation can know the human toll that repealing this law would take
If you or a loved one has directly benefited from the health care reform law, send your story to healthcarestories@mail.house.gov
