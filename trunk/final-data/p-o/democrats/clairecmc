Because so many have asked...no, it's not a secret. The 4 who voted no on secret holds: Sen Ensign, Sen Lee, Sen DeMint, and Sen Paul.
@EricMayle Sen Ensign,Sen Lee,Sen DeMint,& Sen Paul voted no. 
Not sure why.Secret holds are no friend of Americans who want accountability.
Woooohooooo! We did it! The Rules of the United States Senate now prohibit secret holds. The vote was 92 -4.
KMOX and Mark Reardon this afternoon.
Liked bipartisan seating tonight.Less like a team sporting event,more serious.Got to know new Sen Moran(R-KS) better since we sat together.
Glad that seat mate for tonight is new R Sen Jerry Moran from KS.He's also KU grad.The D v R thing is probably easier than Tiger v Jayhawk.
@JRosie89 You might take a look at clairecmc.tumblr.com  The blog post on there "Why I don't follow you" explains why I like twitter.
