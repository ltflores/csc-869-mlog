@greyparker ,  sadly it appears as though youre right.
Are Rs happy w/ high unemployment?  Corp profits are up, easier to get scabs workers to cross line,  workers afraid to question bosses
look, Rs campaigned on "where's the jobs":.  Isn't it fair to ask them produce something, anything to produce jobs?
Rs' 8th week in Majority and NO JOBS Bill in sight! What in the world are the doing!?!?!?!
Workers standing strong MN. What about you?
All Fired Up! even in the freezing cold for Workers Rights. http://yfrog.com/h2dgnwyj
Minnesotans overcoming years of Vikings-Packers rivalry to stand w/ workers of Wisconsin. http://yfrog.com/h37thtxj
Thank you to all people in ALL 50 states who stand w/ Public Employees in WI. You're standing for yourself too!
Proud to stand in 6 degree weather in St.Paul, MN for right to collectively bargain. Workers rights are human rights!
@LFRGary, what if organized to promote, secure, and protect collective bargaining for all workers? Cynicism is the only true obstacle.

Whether Sacramento, NYC, StPaul, let us hear from you. Stand for collective bargaining in America.

@Pnthrgrlgail, I support President Obama.  I believe he stands with working ppl; he has said so re WI. I appreciate his supportive words.
@lovelyladypa, sorry but I am not going to jump when say so.
@Pnthrgrlgail I am with Obama 100 percent.
@twa9999 my religion is not relavant to my opposition to Walker's union busting.

Gov Walker, WI, is a bully; MUST be stood up to. Not budget, but about collective bargaining. Don't back down men & women of labor.
42 years under Khadafy; now he is murdering his ppl whole sale.
@SaleemaGul, yes the House should condemn Khadafy's action.  Let's work on it.
Lybian military firing live rounds at protesters. Ppl not backing down. Khadafy revealed as truly brutal murderous.
@ungaro, right you are. Ppl need information to make good choices. So, let's keep up the fight for NPR and PBS.
@downwithtyranny, America needs progressive bloggers to remember the hopeful and patient are not suckers, weakings, or chumps.
@downwithtyranny, Ds passed sweeping Wall Street Reform, then election came. Cynical progressives checked out, independents believed hype.
@maysoonzayid, yes, I was disappointed.
W/ CR & Amend'ts, Rs want to reward dirty polluters by gutting EPA, right-wing media by gutting NPR, Wall Street Banksters by gutting CFPB.
Only "jobs bill" Rs introduce is Steve King's effort to gut Davis-Bacon, prevailing wage law.
In #CR, House GOP  slashes budget for agencies charged w/ policing Wall Street. GOP wld rather reward donors than help Americans.
@ProfitMohammed, I believe in Israel & Palestine, living in peace side by side as two secure states. I reject theocracy, ancient maps, etc.

@BinQuickBlog, if the test is perfection, we all fail. Yes, I too have my complaints, but it's no time to abandon ship Obama. Seriously.
@slevinger, Sadly, too many disgusting ones.
Che Rhymefest Smith diving into public service in chicago for alderman. Exciting to see hip hop generation taking control. Very cool.
Neugebauer amendment to cut funds to repair #WH simply contemptuous of #POTUS. Disgusting.
@KID_A_KID_A, rather than cut responsiveness of govt, I prefer asking wealthy to pay fair share to nation which helped them get wealthy.
Important not to confuse cynicism w/ wisdom. Not 'smart', in-the-know or wise to declare everything/one is crooked, no-good, on the take.
@BinQuickBlog ,  Obama is on our side, Walker is not.  Walker is an avowed adversary of workers.   Make no false equivalency.
@TheBeadsman, labor is not corrupt, but what about corporate abuses? Goldman, Enron, WorldCom, Countrywide? BearStearns,Lehman, etc.?
@UnderempAmerica, progressives in congress have not ignored 99ers. Led by CPC members, we are orginal co-authors of 99ers bill.
@PhilPerspective, yes, I intent to be in WI, but I am still in DC dealing w/ the reckless republican CR.

@NickKristof is it true that Bahraini police are using live rounds, not only rubber bullets?
Working ppl of Madison, you are inspiring working ppl all over America. Proud you are my next door neighbor!

Men and women of Labor in WI took a page from Egypt. Go WI go! Your buddies to the west (MN) are with you!
