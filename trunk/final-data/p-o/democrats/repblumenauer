Thanks @freepress @moveon @credomobile for delivering 1.2 million petitions urging Congress to defend not defund public broadcasting.
Outrageous -PJ Crowley leaving State Department for saying the truth about treatment of Bradley Manning. Obama needs to fix this.

New majority has brought Styrofoam back to House cafeteria. I can hardly wait for the lead paint. Maybe we can ask China for other ideas.
Obama's declaration that DOMA is unconstitutional is the most significant presidential statement on discrimination since Civil Rights Act.

Just left Fox news debating NPR. Actually treated fairly for once. About to catch plane and be home for a week.
Looking forward to debating public broadcasting w/ Lamborn on NPR Talk of Nation in 10 minutes and on Fox News this weekend.
Defense of PBS is moved to around 4:30, voting No on the Patriot Act first

The most important thing we need to do is change the way we do business rather than just taxing more or cutting budgets http://bit.ly/g6pPHp
Whoa! Is this too reasonable for Congress? http://bit.ly/hBmjcd
Everyone in Congress should read @davidmwessel's WSJ column about the stubborn facts of the deficit. Fantastic! http://on.wsj.com/hW2A7J
The reading of the Constitution was actually quite moving. Sat thru it all. Hope everyone was not just reading but thinking about it.
Another Oregon news outlet gets a complicated but important story right. Why is it so hard for Fox News? @KATUNews http://bit.ly/fjDbM8
More death panel weirdness. Thought we were past it, but in Oregon we understand. Two examples http://bit.ly/f7CJdV http://bit.ly/fnVCgV
Finally, #DADT repeal! Victory for American Justice and military. In 10 yrs, people will wonder: why the controversy? Most wonder already.
Thinking about battles ahead for next congress, Politifact’s Lie of the Year should be required reading http://bit.ly/gxeLCp
RT @pourmecoffee: For its #DADT debate, hope Senate waives the "Reading of @SenJohnMccain's Prior Positions" which could take hours.
Voted (again) to repeal DADT. Will 3rd time be the charm for Senate? For sake of thousands GLBT soldiers, millions of Americans, I hope so.
Dream Act passes and kids in House gallery explode in applause...they are the American Dream. On to the Senate!

Lost in election madness: a real issue! Oregon civil engineers grade our infrastructure "C-". The wonder is that grade not worse.

Speaker Pelosi: "passing this bill means being a woman will no longer be a pre existing condition". Go Nancy go!
Boehner should be ashamed that we are not working together. It was his call for Republicans not to legislate but to "communicate."
Thanks! RT@colinmeloy Tuned in to the house HCR debate in time to see our man @repblumenauer speak his peace. proud to be a Portlander.
John Dingell spoke, bringing 77 continuous years of family history fighting for health care reform - talk about historic!
1 vote down, 2 to go before the House finishes its job on #hcr. 224 yes on rule makes me predict 219 to 222 votes for final passage-needs216
Instead of applauding House disruptions or egging on protesters, why aren't republicans condemning their racist and homophobic acts?
Should Republicans applaud protesters screaming in the House gallery?   --- Not smart
The excitement begins: a quick speech and demanding a vote on the
Journal. Every bit helps - no small actions today as part of
history.
RT @jackhutton @cspanwj Great to see a bike commute advocate in congress! -- Thanks Jack!
How cool: Nuns calling out the Bishops and supporting health reform http://tiny.cc/8RNdU
Proud to stand w/ MoveOn, Kos, other progressives and my constituents in saying “pass this bill.”
Made point at least 100 congress people would be unable to get insurance due to preexisting conditions. Maybe then they would support reform
Health care homestretch. People need to use their "inner wonk," not outsource analysis to idiot "shouting heads." Facts are clear.
