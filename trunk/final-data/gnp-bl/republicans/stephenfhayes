There is something fitting about the WH having Joe Biden, who oversaw the $814 billion stimulus, as its lead negotiator on debt/deficits.
@kfleeter Congrats. Lots to like about the Bolts. All Bolts players tapped their sticks at Verizon when wounded warriors introduced. Classy

Total embarrassment for the #Caps. Again. Arguably the most talented roster in the NHL and another early exit. Boudreau must go...
Interesting, not new. Links well-established. RT @Drudge_Report: Report Highlight Links Between Iran, al-Qaeda... http://drudge.tw/iILO0e
This is one of the most undisciplined series I've ever seen. George McPhee has to consider firing Boudreaux, no? Embarrassing. #Caps
One journalist's "small role" is another reporter's "key piece of evidence."
The chronology in NYT piece tracks w/what I've been told. So is it a "small role" if Qahtani gave up nom de guerre of key UBL courier?
Hmmm RT: @nytjim NYT reports that brutal interrogations "played a small role at most" in leading US to UBL http://nyti.ms/mLkJFN #obl
#Caps down 0-3. Lack of urgency, stupid penalties, missed assignments, no focus, foolish attempt to sit on a 3-2 lead. #itsthecoaching
RT @BreakingNews: Panetta acknowledges information from waterboarded detainees was used to help plan mission at bin Laden's compound - NBC
Was UBL compound deliberately chosen to embarrass Pakistan's civilian gov & further poison US/Pakistani relations - one last bin Laden plot?
Agree RT: @DavidCornDC Attn on POTUS poll #'s re OBL raid pointless. Issue is not bump, but whether GOP weak-on-defense charge now useles
Has anyone made this claim? RT: @DavidCornDC Carney: "Not the case" that one piece of info from 8 years ago led to this operation. #whbrief
This 2009 Washington Post article on KSM, the "preeminent source" on AQ for the CIA, is very useful. http://wapo.st/RfR1V
KSM was uncooperative before EITs. He was not only cooperative afterwards, he conducted "terrorist tutorials" on AQ, its personnel & ops
led to the name of the courier and also that KSM (or al Libi or Qahtani) did not provide that info *while* subjected to EITs. (3/3)
But whether those techniques turned him from an uncooperative detainee into a cooperative one. So entirely consistent to say that EITs (2/3)
Widespread misunderstanding of EITs and their role. The question is not whether KSM spit out names *during* a waterboarding session (1/3)
Simply not true. RT @daveweigel: Feinstein again: to best of our knowledge info didn't come from enhanced interrogation
Secondary issue. Question is source of info/value. @daveweigel: Feinstein: No evidence right now that info leading to OBL came from Gitmo
Smart piece. RT: @WSJopinion McGurn: UBL's Last Challenge-to GOPers: Where are GOP candidates on foreign policy? http://on.wsj.com/imURFn
RT @LCGpolling: The optics of the OBL operation decision suggest a decisive POTUS, which is something Obama desperately needed.
RT @LCGpolling: While the shelf life of events like OBL's killing is increasingly short, the bump for Obama may have some lasting effect ...
RT @rickklein: VP Cheney to @jonkarl: "The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation."
