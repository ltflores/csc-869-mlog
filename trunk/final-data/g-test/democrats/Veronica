@Israelrom Its called Cafe, one of the music choices YouTube gives you.
Here's a little preview of an upcoming segment on @Qore, where we look at an interactive menu in London! http://t.co/DenLbo8
@mrenygma yes, it was a CableCARD issue for us as well. I'm working with them tomorrow to try and fix it.
@thevowel BAM! It was London, lots of walking to the tube and to shoots. I think I had my second best day steps-wise that week.
I'll be hosting the live Digg Dialogg today with @guykawasaki at 1:30 PT: http://revision3.com/watch
@rowast really?? how funny! /cc @buzzoutloud
@jelmertjeuh only nominally and on the internet.
@schmalden sweet! though, I'm fighting with Comcast over my HBO, they can't seem to fix it!!
@jelmertjeuh who are you?
@robstak jealous.
@leafbox geocaching.com!
@jogger30a hah! no, does my picture look that way?
Check out my interview with Brian Farnham & Tony Brancato of AOLs Patch for @DiceTechJobs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0upA4XuI6E
@michaelparks11 Einstein/Hawking was probably my favorite.
OK, @ryan just introduced me to Epic Rap Battles of History. HOW DID I MISS THIS?! http://t.co/AbCUepB
@tonysphere yay, @aboutdotme emails reply to the sender directly now! my #1 feature request! woot!
@donfubar OMG THAT WAS INSANE!!!
@chosunbimbo thanks!!
@dudeslife they had a booth at WonderCon where you could take a picture.
@cap yeah, if Comcast fixes my damn HBO I just ordered! They're coming out tomorrow at 8am :(
@peaceofjamieson deal! :)
@Fee501st natch!
@Skwidspawn hahaha! yes.
@dudeslife it was more methodology rather than recipes!
Mixology class was great, though I'm totally still the kiss-ass that tries to answer all of the teachers questions before anyone else. #nerd
@ctomasi hah! that's cute.
@paulandstorm yes, and I'll wear an eyepatch.
@Fee501st I will try.
Taking a mixology class today! #booze #backupplan
@escapist to be fair, the Beats line is actually pretty good, quality-wise. That being said, Monster Cable (who makes them) can suck it.
The cat @mrlittlejeans is purring like he actually missed me. Or he might just have a particularly violent hairball.
@sporfle thanks for looking out though, that has happened before and it's pretty lame!
@sporfle of course, I host a web series for them ;)
Sweet! RT @feliciaday: Gratz to The Annoying Orange!  They just released a cool iPhone game: Kitchen Carnage. http://t.co/2gfqgBu
@harlotqueen not my laptop!!!
@BOMBMatt sweet! I could use one right now ;)
Two hours left to bid on the @Tekzilla #PlayForJapan auction for Japanese earthquake victims! http://t.co/6bohiQK
@DaleboyUK only 3 days! I've never been to Scotland, I've always wanted to!
@hodgman I'll drink a pint for you. Any favorites? Sorry, "favourites?"
Last night in London! Gonna drink some beers and pass out before the long flight tomorrow. Can't believe the awesome weather we had!!
@177aria AH! Of course, and hello! He's doing great in London, busting his butt as always!
@177aria we drive to most locations, unless it's very far away! Which Chris do you mean?
@mccPDX thanks!
@puppyfarts haha! that made me lol.
Butt is it art? (NSFW) http://instagr.am/p/C5UiF/
@The_T I brought it with me from San Francisco, you can thank me later.
@SpleenlessD thanks!
@extralife you know you just said spu... oh, nevermind.
@BOMBMatt I like it! It's funny, and people are passionate.
@parislemon mmm. curds.
@JDaab yeah, there's a new cache in it's place now: http://t.co/h8Z56CH
@laughingsquid thanks! I'm really excited about it.
@chrisjniles you don't like it? what's wrong with it?
The new redesign of geocaching.com looks great! #geocaching
@zacminor of course!
@theCaoboi @extralife @theIceflow @1Password I use 1password too!

Yikes RT @ImagesDt: LastPass, a Password Service, Warns of Possible Hacking Attack - http://j.mp/iQ5ytc
@zacminor I'm creepy like that.
RT @zacminor: Did you know that @Veronica is in the new Fallout DLC? She also watches every @dtoidshow taping from 5 feet away http://t. ...
@fightingmink that street was blocked off because of the fire.
@Samsungservice I wish you had sent these to my yesterday, we already shot the segment. Oh well.
@willsmith @donttrythis I have seen this collection. It is both terrifying and awe-inspiring. Mostly just kind of badass.
@ZackN9ne I took public transportation for the last 10 years, I'm happy to have a car to use once in a while.
@ZackN9ne do you send that message to everyone who drives a car?
@CAntista I'd wait a while before going home.
@streamlinedman yes?
Stuck in a massive traffic jam due to a fire on Folsom (near 7th). Hope everyone is ok! http://twitpic.com/4th5pt
@maubrowncow groooooosssss
@VERONICAL0VE lol.
@Monkey_Pants are you doing any of the mocap yourself, or just directing?
@fruhlinger haha, nope, after :) /cc @ryan
@fruhlinger we're coming in June, let's get dinner! /cc @ryan
@cap @mg oh no! how about this Saturday? Maybe I can pull @ryan away from work.
@CAntista ok, that just actually elicited a LOL from me. A real LOL.
@josteinhh are you defending car lashes? Are these YOUR car lashes? :)
Car lashes. Seriously. I thought this was a YouTube joke, but it's real. http://instagr.am/p/ENAVv/
@ameyapendse this... is true.
I think I just agreed to a 6:15am Sunday news hit. I should probably make the coffee the night before...
@zzzoren awesome! which book are you on?
@zazealya that is not how a RT works. While it's a very nice sentiment, I did not say it.
@Guitardude2744 yay!
@zamn @mikebarish yes!!
Surely someone can make an HDTV version! “@mikebarish: It's a damn shame that future generations won't get to enjoy wood-paneled TVs.”
@outofocus @cosentino you should hear me and @joshlawrence sing that at karaoke sometime. We do even better.
@caseymckinnon haha, you wouldn't be the first!
@gregalor dude. sweet.
@rwentechaney it was great to meet you! enjoy your @rickshawbags!
@kristykorcz we have even LESS time to save for retirement now!
