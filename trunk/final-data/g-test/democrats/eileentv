@extralife @raygun01 I'm not supposed to experience this. I'm short!
@radiocolin and the water pressure! ugh.
I'm taller than the shower head in my hotel -- and I'm not tall. *headslap*
@mohalen app called label maker.
This poor lady, puked in the cab line. I feel bad for her cab driver. #Vegas  http://twitpic.com/4j37xq
We are family ;) http://instagr.am/p/DAcym/
Vegas here we come! w/ @anelf3 & @hotmilkgt (@ Virgin America- SFO) http://picplz.com/Qn3d
Liking X Construction (today's free Amazon app).  But the screams of terror when a train falls,  really makes you feel like a failure!
Jango doesn't like all the social media attention Sawyer is getting. http://instagr.am/p/C_PWc/
@kylekrieg just me skyping in from Vegas. The rest of the AAA crew will be home.
@kerotab today. I'll be there till thurs.
Been fighting @acedtect's germs all week. So far so good, but now I'm headed to Vegas for NAB. My kit of cold preventatives are coming with.

@theCaoboi free is difficult. I really like DoggCatcher (not free) @CBasala
@thetelevixen Why the hell would Damon put the moonstone in a soapdish? Like that sentence?
@mattcutts Levy is going to be a guest on TWiG in a few weeks :) The 27th!
@beavenour It's called Jorte. Enjoy!
@TonyRetrobot you're welcome!
@nicolespag i'm fighting the, "I'm not sick, before I travel" issue.

@bryanjager my Nexus S is horrible with battery life -- even on standby. I find myself constantly conserving. I need a spare batt
@bryanjager you must be using it more than me. I tried to emulate how I use my iPad. Reading, videos, some gaming, minor browsing and email
@MacintoshAddict very close and I tried to use it the same way I use my iPad
@PatrickKaine I hadn't charged it for 2 days and when I gave it to Jason it was at 64%
@ronxo I am! :) This game got really exciting. I turned it on and it was 7-1
@ronxo hey, I'm watching that game on the MLB at bat app :)
I don't think I gave the XOOM enough credit on @androidshow. Battery life is awesome, and probably why it's so heavy!
@VodooXTC I LOVE reading on a tablet - including the XOOM. It sucks when I have to turn it off at the beginning of a flight. @raygun01
@HateBadDesign he took mine. But I used the company card to buy it, so it's kinda his too!
Just loaned the XOOM to @raygun01. Wonder what he'll think of it? Dun-dun-dun.
listening to "boy" by Ra Ra Riot on Play. "Testing Play for Android " http://bit.ly/hzcX0D
I'm paranoid today ;) ♫ http://sdtk.fm/fWlQ69 #soundtracking
I'm also very happy when listening to the new Peter Bjorn and John http://rd.io/x/QFd2PkkIuA Thx @rdio! Social music discovery ftw!
Android peeps. I can't praise this app enough! RT @david_carmona: New App - Little Photo via @eileentv http://picplz.com/JkZ3

Another great week talking to my iOS homies @extralife & @hawkito. http://infostripe.com/appslappy

@brax4444 really? Its cheaper than 35 cents?
I know I can eat a better meal, but this is all I want right now. http://instagr.am/p/C30HN/
I don't understand Empire Avenue and I don't think I'll seek to try and understand it. I just know that I'm very cheap. http://bit.ly/kL95jU
If you're nervous like me tune into TNT today at 5:30p eastern to hear @SGgrc explain/explore the LastPass issue: http://live.twit.tv/

RT @rawmeet: @eileentv but as forward thinkers, we should not abandon these guys. they need our support. just don't have "password" as t ...
@WoodWhisperer yes, hi! See you at Nerdtacular!
RT @bryanjager: @eileentv The cloud is ready. Some co's security is not hardened. Many co's r doing cloud right. Just don't hear. NOT go ...
@notpatrick you are truly nicer than your reputation ;)
@WoodWhisperer I use 1pass too,  but was going to switch and use one service only.
@notpatrick so you vote, stay with Last Pass? I still use both, but was ready to commit to one.
@magtimmag why did you delete?
And I was ready to pick Last Pass over 1password. Once again, the cloud is just not ready for primetime.
@kichelle Mint Chip :)
Way to go Sharks! #NHL
@dennislaska thank you very much!
@megsyb yay! Next time I'll send you one of Jango and Sawyer :)
