On the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight, I was notified that my iPad with the engraving of "cupcakes + rockets" had shipped.

Surrounded by vegetarian programmers!
omg, Cute Roulette: http://cuteroulette.com you're welcome.
Wow, you can get a 23andMe kit for free tomorrow: http://is.gd/d3Z1BN Tempting... (thx @erigentry)
@Dave_Stein all depends on what technologies/experiments you want to use and what rocket launch deal you get, so yeah, it can vary widely.
@changelogshow thanks for the write up! Just a quick correction: http://spacehack.org is my site, my friends made spacelog (not me).
@listrophy I'll be doing dinner at the Plant Cafe if you signed up for that one! Otherwise I'll be around throughout the day.
@calavera hadn't seen it before - will have to check it out, thanks!
@calavera @auser @jackdanger thanks so much :)
Thanks to everyone at #CodeConf ! Lovely to geek out about space stuff with such a super nice crowd.
Ha! People now think I live in New Zealand thanks to a vague speaker intro. It's cool, I can move.
RT @iangreenleaf: Turns out anyone (really) can make significant contributions to space exploration: http://spacehack.org
RT @gigaom: GitHubâ€™s Sold-Out CodeConf Could Be First of Many http://dlvr.it/MzVyh
The Now: enjoying a lovely view of SF before my talk at #CodeConf tomorrow http://flic.kr/p/9x2igp
CodeConf speaker + githubber dinner! Definitely amusing ideas going around.
@Funzafunza yay, awesome!
@funzafunza did you ever post the interview from SXSW? just curious :)
@CameronNeylon @davidwhogg there's also http://www.exquisitetweets.com/ that nicely lays out all the tweets onto one URL.
@keithdok great interview choices for SuicideGirls! happy to see science geeks making appearances. (i briefly used to write columns on SG)
Prepping for a full weekend at #codeconf !
A talk by @mike_ftw for all freelancers to watch about contracts, etc.: http://vimeo.com/22053820 (I learned about kill fees the hard way)
@davidwhogg just caught your great talk from #dotastro & tweeted it out (left Oxford early). wish i caught you in person, maybe next year!
Good talk on the computer science behind Astrometry.net: http://is.gd/fGn4gh you may remember them from Flickr http://is.gd/Acpnx1 #dotastro
...I apparently can't read a respectable article about physics without thinking that Tevatron would make a great Transformers robot name.
There should be Autobot+Decepticon Transformers called Tevatron, &when their powers collide, they create Higgs Bosotron! http://is.gd/4Pr7vQ
Packing up at New College in Oxford, headed to Heathrow and then SFO. Had a great time with everyone at #dotastro !
In case you're in the mood for some hot rocket porn: http://www.spacex.com/falcon_heavy.php 3.8 million pounds of liftoff thrust, oh yeah.
Virgin Oceanic will expand the reach of human exploration on our planet: http://www.virginoceanic.com/ (so incredibly exciting!)
@k_lau omg, SO cool! i've been wanting to befriend more oceanic explorer types - would be great to bring in to science hackery type stuff...
@schingler sure! start an email thread about it, maybe?
Properly feel like I'm in a movie. Walking around a castle in Oxford in the rain.
@SpaceXer if I wanted to attend a SpaceX launch (which I very much do!), who/what should I interface w/? My email is ariel@arielwaldman.com
@flaneur I'm short on $ and time, so I'm not going to go. Not too sad, I do actually really want to see a SpaceX launch.
Hearing the NASA STS-134 space shuttle launch is being delayed to April 29th. Looks like I won't go. Hope to catch a SpaceX launch someday.
Love coworking with people who say things like "let's get an early start tomorrow. say, noon?". San Francisco, you have my <3.
@epistemental did you chat at all about the Google Lunar X Prize? Always curious to hear from Google about it...
@verbal oh, please put that on Flickr as a caption contest
@rosical @emgollie fyi, IFTF is having an open coworking day next week: http://iftfcoworking.pbworks.com (feel free to fwd to ppl you know!)
NASA announces results of EPIC space-time experiment: http://1.usa.gov/jDixDg (aka, 'SCIENCE, it works, bitches' via @russss)
It's kind of amazing to me that it hasn't even been 100 yrs since we learned that the Milky Way galaxy isn't the ONLY galaxy in the universe
...it's fun to read the article in that last tweet if you pretend to be a historian from the future when space travel is ubiquitous.
"My view of the future is, maybe in 30-40 years, most people who want to go to space will have the opportunity to do it" http://is.gd/23yGyo
Coworking with @dburka @kevinrose and @hutchins at the @milk office. Supposedly 83 degrees in SF right now!
@SpaceXer as I've mentioned before: *please* implement permalinks! it's not much like a blog without them.
@drkiki @jamiemcquay thx! they're having a whole citizen science track this year.
Excited to announce that I will be keynoting at OSCON! http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/20185 (registration is open)
Was hoping to get a 2nd wind tonight, but waking up at 6am really nips that in the bud. Great long day at @iftf. Now for the future of sleep
@odannyboy I applied to that job a couple years ago - you get an automatic kickback email from "jointheforce" ;)
@timoni have you talked to @odannyboy? not sure if ur on the same path, but I know he's been looking to mentor someone. maybe worth a chat.

Yay, lunch with the A-team: @caseorganic @aaronpk @anselm
Want to check out Institute For The Future (@iftf) and hack on fun stuff? Come cowork next week! http://iftfcoworking.pbworks.com
Stargate Universe is axed soon :( I wanted it 2b the space traveling show of my gen. Great science concepts were explored. cc/ @mikamckinnon
@drkiki wow, great interview catch! tell him to come to the next science hack day! ;)
@JenLucPiquant @mikamckinnon agreed! you have fascinating work that everyone would love to hear more about.
I'm aggregating all your answers to my previous tweet on my new Open Science tumblr: http://is.gd/EOXKSE (an area I'm focusing on @iftf)
What current topic areas of science do you think have some of the most exciting futures? (e.g. synthetic life, etc.)
@jessykate @ipeirotis ooo, I want to go! are they only open to academic papers or would they accept conference-type talk proposals?
@blech we should go see movies together! science documentaries ftw :)
OH: "We need a laser battle station but no one wants to fund it" - @iftf coworking day
@blech I was hearing that in the beginning of reptiles it was less than today, but when it became greater it allowed dinosaurs to thrive.
Learning T-Rex 33% more efficient than humans at breathing & most modern lizards can't breathe while running. Any paleontologists follow me?
@gretared as a BlackBerry and iPod Touch owner, my response is... uhm, no.
RT @wilw: Well, I guess I'm done using TwitPic and will download and delete whatever I have there. Bummer. I liked TwitPic. http://is.gd/wtjBle
@rosical - @erigentry should be the shoe in for attending! http://genentechgirlgeekdinner-estw.eventbrite.com/
omg, forget robots, we need telepresence *balloons* at institute for the future: http://is.gd/Lb7g2c cc/ @iftf
@benhammersley "futureswoon" <3
@NASAJuno can you use Flickr instead of TwitPic? It will be easier for people to find, tag, comment, favorite & share your great photos!
@jessykate i agree w/ your comment! http://is.gd/qOFFQ4 i was recently told i was less successful b/c i hadn't sold a startup cc/ @mike_ftw
NASA's Juno Mission site is pretty lovely - like having a Discovery/Science Channel show in your browser: http://missionjuno.swri.edu
