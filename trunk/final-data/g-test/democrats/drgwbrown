@n8wide @squintinginfog The willingness to admit we do not know everything, or have it perfect ourselves, also makes a huge difference. :-)
It is hard to hate anyone if you truly believe God chooses to love everyone.
Taking third oldest daughter to doctor in Louisville tomorrow.  Time to stop gifting the world with my frustration & anger. Shalom.
@JeffersonObama I get frustrated too. I want him to do everything I want--end the wars, tax the wealthy, support workers--Pres can't do all
@JeffersonObama It is sad to watch Presidents age in office trying to do the impossible for the ungrateful.
@JeffersonObama I think we have lost our minds. We elect him, we fill one half of Congress with Tea Party, and then we complain.
@JeffersonObama I'm old enough to remember when the person who won became "our" President. Now its attack from day one, even from supporters

OK, fed up, done mouthing off, doesn't help anyway, headed to the climbing gym.
@DianeRavitch They know! Keeping the attention on school as cause avoids having to deal with refusing to pay workers & increasing poverty!
GOP strategies for global warming & economic failure the same. Misdirect attention with phony issues. Education is the false issue for econ.
If Indiana believes they have a way to actually determine ineffective teachers, why keep them at all? And, I am a union rep.
There is no way an administrator in our consolidated schools can evaluate every teacher every year.
@kinnick72 I am both a teacher and a professor of education and I am ready to leave. Have two daughters trying to enter the profession :-(

What am I missing on the change in NBC? No coverage of labor rallies. Now explain gas price inflation by asking oil spokesman only? WTH?
@DianeRavitch 2/2 But, if school has to place w ineffective a second year must notify parents! Can't imagine admin eval'ing all every year.
@DianeRavitch IN said to be considering plan to evaluate teachers yearly, label ineffective ones, allow children placed w them one year 1/2
Shirley Maclaine on Oprah talking about UFO's over her hot tub. I am guessing they took home a negative report.  She cracks me up.

@JeffersonObama Yes, it is very sad. I just have a personal connection to Sudan and it amazes me how many places are being destroyed.
@JeffersonObama Sudan blew itself up while we sat back and ignored decades of genocide as well.
@revnaomi Amazing, wonderful, and blessed.
@revnaomi Pointed to our crosses as connection with Ethiopian boy across languages; he said in words I understood "I love you as God loves."

@ke5mkt My next break will be end of May for the 500. My wife is going with me this year.
@ke5mkt Any plans for one soon?
@ke5mkt So, how are things otherwise?
@Purplegrass So how do we clone Bernie Sanders?

@mike__friesen Thanks, it was a blessing to be invited.
OK, more pressing need time to get some dinner with wife and daughter. peace
@mike__friesen These are very friendly country people with a pretty traditional read on the Bible. So, just gently inviting deeper.
@rev3j @orpheus42 @n8wide Agreed. It flies in the face of every positive argument. Still haven't read much on that side and its not all his.
@mike__friesen Tried not to overdo the mystical for this group but still invite them in the direction of experiencing God not just studying.

@kAtAstic10 no doubt. Of course the networks take polls that say people think what the network told them for days & call that news too!
@kAtAstic10 Agree again! Tired of seeing even "news" feeds linking to blogs. Kids study "fact" and "opinion" in the primary grades!

@kAtAstic10 Understand, thought maybe we had an escalating agreement going, but did not want you to think I was saying something different.
@kAtAstic10 I agreed with you. You keep responding as if I am arguing.
Local low turn out primary results on news: still say turn out would have been much heavier with none of the above on the ballot. pickaloser

New song that will not leave my head is Sarah Hart's "Better than a Hallelujah."
@mike__friesen Pretty well for a crazy man! 10 school days left. Each day with kids examining what we want to know about life. It's good.
@tcbird1 Ours won't be in until during the summer.  Still hoping some of my "no way" kids proved people wrong!
@tragic_pizza Sorry to hear it. Although considering the physical place where you live, it might be odd to be in a good place?
@tcbird1 Now w all the stress this year, if somebody could remind teachers, we'd really be on to something! Lots of turmoil w10 days left.
