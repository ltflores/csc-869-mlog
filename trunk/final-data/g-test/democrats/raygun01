Another Astronomically Awesome All About Android! OK, maybe that's overdoing it but @kevinpurdy was a great guest. Publishes tomorrow!
RT @psyburat: "[Getting Things Done] is a very efficient cult." -@raygun01 (ha! I'm happy someone caught that!)
All About Android goes live in about an hour at live.twit.tv! @eileentv @ronxo myself and today's guest, @kevinpurdy! See you then.
@amandafrench ha! Nice shout out! Maybe someone will actually get that ball rolling now.
Brand spanking new grill means flank steak tonight. win
@extralife @eileentv amen!!!
I was interviewed for this site, along with many other names you'll recognize throughout the coming weeks! http://t.co/dcK6zJQ
@eileentv I'm happy that's not my hotel room.
@kevinchen Understood. Believe me, $2 is by no means the end of the world. I just have little daily use for HDR. Hence, not worth it 2 me.
@kevinchen me too what?  You used that app? What did you think?
RT @PhoneBoy: @raygun01 what camera app do u recommend for Android? (I like Vignette a lot but it's slow on moto droid. Otherwise,  great!)
I should clarify that Pro HDR isn't a BAD app..  just not worth $2 for such a single purpose app.
Doh. Forgot that the refund policy for Android Market is now 15 minutes and not 24 hrs. I now own Pro HDR.
@brandonlpierce I believe @shwood uses VidBlaster but it costs $$.  Not sure of a free alternative. Or try screen cap s/w like iseeu.
Can App Inventor be used for tablets? #xoom
@LarryOrtiz you have a bit too much faith in my abilities to program for Android. :)
Here's a reason for me to use the Xoom every day once the application exists: tablet optimized programmable sound board.  :) does it exist?
@sarahlane hmmmm.  Hearty and vodka don't seem like they go together. I'm sorry my homeland let you down.
@sarahlane Nice! Tell me you tried it?
@drkiki so awesome seeing you and the little guy too!  He's adorable,  of course!
Nice! A Kickstarter project that I pitched in for finally came to completion! :) http://bit.ly/govCZI $$ well spent.
Just saw @drkiki and son. He is tiny. He is where Lucy was 1 year ago, yet it seems SO long ago. I miss that tiny ball of warmth.
@cabbieBot So far, the need appears to be when I'm on my phone and need to write a longer email, it's easier to use the Xoom for that.
#Xoom is a tad heavy but the good ol' rest it on your legs technique works fine. I'm enjoying Honeycomb, though occasional UI hangups.
Gmail for Honeycomb screams for chat integration. #xoom
Testing out the Twitter app on the Motorola Xoom. Kind of boring looking to be honest.
@NotMyRealName Funny, we had that conversation when @eileentv gave me the tablet. I'd heard it was on the back before I got it. :)
@eileentv My initial reaction is "Woo-Hoo! Free XOOM tablet! (for a few days)" I'm curious to see how I find ways to "need" to use it. :)
@JonStrickland That's a smart play right there.
Going to NAB? Check out @NewTekInc 's Broadcast Minds session with @leolaporte and others.
@PhatEmoKid Shut up you.... guy.
@benpike Unfortunately... yes.
Claritan-D: Works. Claritan minus the D: Doesn't Work. Claritan + Sudafed (as the D replacement) works but WHOA... I'm floating in space.
The Commodore 64 is back! http://m.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/the-commodore-64-is-back/12192 (want!)
I don't use GetGlue myself... but if YOU do, here you go! http://bit.ly/eG0Nn7 #aaa
@jeffthefate I won't say that its the snappiest thing  in the world, but its serviceable until I can upgrade my hardware.

@JoshHilp You don't HAVE to.... but if you do, post it on YouTube and send us a link. :)
@Veronica @extralife un-read! un-read!
All About Android #2 (MP3) now published! Refresh your feeds or go here: http://bit.ly/hlDDiw Video encoding, soon to be published!
My dad will never learn not to pass along forwarded WMV files via email. I must come to terms with this. It's in his DNA.
@gkneeisme @eileentv on second thought it's a mixture of being hungry and having Rainbow Connection stuck in my head on repeat.
@dogg Had to know the Xoom would not work right when it counts. :/ Thanks!
@Catatonic That would work if we saw a green person... but all we saw was green. Nothing else. So then, all we'd see is grey.
Just finalizing today's All About Android with @eileentv and @ronxo! Catch it live tonight in 40 min at live.twit.tv (5pm PT every Monday)
RT @AdobeAE: That site and many more good source of After Effects tutorials and information are listed here: http://bit.ly/c06llu (WOOT!)
OK cough. Remnant of a flu that is now three weeks past. Exit my lungs. PLEEEEASE. So incredibly annoying.
RT @metal0130: the videocopilot is a .net domain, the .com leads to a ad-squatter. Good luck with whatever you are working on! (oops! thx)
Whatdaya know, here's another After Effects site loaded with tutorials: http://bit.ly/sC8s7
After Effects tutorials: videocopilot.com, ae.tutsplus.com/tutorials, lynda.com, iTunes U, adobe.ly/dk4EEW, 3rdstg.ca/shortsuite Thx to all!
Surprisingly, today is the first time I've slammed my head into one of the low doorways here at the cottage. How? Busy staring at my food.
@ato220 ooooooooo LIKE!  Thanks for the suggestion!
@wkrwk @stephenbeacham Stephen does a fantastic job!
@anagh_29 when I flash a new rom it defaults to that sometimes.  It lasts only for a few days before I get sick of it again.
@virgiliocorrado please!  Almost no such thing.
Wow,  I MUST be having a good vacation. Didn't hear the news about Bin Laden.
@bnycastro radical!
@Emann56 good point.  might have to reconsider.  :)  email aaa@twit.tv and let us know how you've been using it!
RT @leolaporte: For those of you who want to buy a brick on the new TWiT Brick House wall of honor - they're on sale now:

@bloodroarXD Requirements for the Netflix app currently are Gingerbread, with Froyo coming soon. That's probably your problem.
@bloodroarXD @eileentv Yes, installed the APK last night and watched a little video on the Droid. :)
Don't forget: No @androidshow next Monday. Instead, show is TOMORROW at 5pm PT http://live.twit.tv discussing #io2011 and Games!
@reidgober OH thank you! Yes, I mentioned that since I had flashed, SetCPU was preset with a few profiles. I didn't know that tho, so thx!!
Some reporter on CNBC just proclaimed that the new Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 "doesn't have the media playback capabilities of the Ipad"... Eh?
@trantjd Oh believe me. Don't cry for me. The truth is I'm already spoiled.
Source code for Google TV Remote released. http://bit.ly/m8PgH5 #io2011 #googletv
@DrBug666 Thank you for playing guitar for Freak in a Jar a few times.
RT @thirdstage: I watch TWiT programs on an old CRT TV and the graphics on left and right are always hidden behind the overscan. (THANK U!)
Android Market for Google TV with Honeycomb.  http://twitpic.com/4wdu7i #io2011 #googletv
@tsantos Cut off at the bottom? or sides?
Those who watch TWiT shows on TV's: Do you ever see over/underscan issues with our graphics/titles?
Oh, and only 4 people near front row got the socks when they were thrown out from stage like guitar pics.
