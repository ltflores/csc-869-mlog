@tonyspeak "Obama...plan to reduce deficit,...by scaling back govt's chief health programs for seniors & the poor." http://huff.to/hb1ZOg
@ib2smrt4u It won't pass because both Dems & GOP leadership are owned by corporate financial elite. Look at Obama's financial advisers.

@dansden Not sure what you mean.  The link is functioning correctly.
The 2012 budget proposals by GOP and Obama both ignore 62% of Americans by LOWERING taxes on the rich http://bit.ly/ijnU7O
Congress is IGNORING THE NATION. 62% of Americans say raising taxes on rich is the 1st step to balancing the budget. http://bit.ly/ijnU7O
46% of those earning MORE THAN $100K/yr say RAISING TAXES ON THE RICH should be the 1ST STEP TO BALANCING THE BUDGET http://bit.ly/ijnU7O

Corporate media is pumping up Ryan's Path To Poverty praising him for 'having a plan' & ignoring People's Budget http://1.usa.gov/fs1XAp
@onevoice2 We need to let Congress know that we know it exists. Corporate media is already praising Ryan saying at least he has a plan
