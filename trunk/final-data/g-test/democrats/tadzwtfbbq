If you still wish to bury your head in the sands (pun intended), don't follow this link: http://bit.ly/gdN2C4 #yegfed
Is this one a) Linda Duncan b) Hugo Chavez c) Trotsky or d) A 1972 Government of Alberta document ? #yegfed
"Alberta should regulate and control the Athabasca tar sands development for the socio-economic development of Albertans." #yegfed
If you refuse to believe d) Business Week, congratulations, you can now volunteer on Ryan Hastman's campaign. #yegfed
Is it a) socialists b) separatists c) Greenpeace or d) Business Week ? #yegfed
Guess the source: "the government has not said whether the proposal will include tar send reserves". #yegfed

@foofighters you guys still believe crazy stuff about AIDS?
@avnishnanda @jaimanchin @naidoo @andrew_leach can we call it the anti-coalition freedom-sands?
@denny1h @robin_ec Plus, you need big time penance to undo the damage they've potentially done. Like millions of dollars to an aids charity.
@denny1h @robin_ec I saw the group listed on their site as recent as two years ago.

@Brucesfarside at rate libs are going they wont form gov either. Maybe we're seeing the decline of the Canada lib party like euro countries?
@Brucesfarside no mention of labour policy there, even greens have a labour platform.
@Brucesfarside then the libs backtracked on anti-scab, and voted against pay equity. How does the platform fare?
@markiemoose looks like dumb kids, not party specific. #yegfed
@Brucesfarside any highlights? Lowlights?
@Brucesfarside how's the lib platform on labour? Haven't read it yet. Their voting record ain't so hot.

@Tony_Tracy @canadianglen have to do it all. folks who are trained/mentored will be bolstered if their arguments mirrored in press.
@Tony_Tracy we shouldn't rely on them, but don't discount the impact of a newspaper on the views on the shop floor.
@canadianglen @tony_tracy the online media referred to is a start, but I think it's time to go big media.
@Tony_Tracy Hugely agreed. Remember when there were labour reporters? It's frightening to think of how much ground we've lost.
@Tony_Tracy great perspective, with the deck stacked against us, worker to worker story telling will win the day.
@Tony_Tracy but I wonder how many releases about progressive policy debates or bargaining victories would be ignored anyways?
@Tony_Tracy yep. those are definitely important. do we have good demographics on readership for those?
@Tony_Tracy at this point even softened views with the occaisional labour focus much appreciated over massage smears and horse races.
@Tony_Tracy print is a dying breed, but still important. The right took a loss on the national post, maybe it's worth it.
@Tony_Tracy I like the online presence of those - but it's time to go big. Would like to see serious talk of left ownership of print media.
@Tony_Tracy agreed. Better online presence is needed, but so is a better presence in the mailboxes, tv sets, and of course, shop floors.
@Tony_Tracy I hope CLC isn't looking at social media as some sort of magic bullet. Any talk of labour buying it's own media?
