Thanks for following OFA staff’s live tweets. Get reactions to tonight’s address at @TheDemocrats. #SOTU
It is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong. #SOTU
From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That’s how we win the future. #SOTU
Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. #SOTU
Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families. #SOTU
This July, we will begin to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. #SOTU
This year, we will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. #SOTU
We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable. We should give them a gov't that’s more competent & efficient. #SOTU
I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. #SOTU
Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same. #SOTU
Instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and move forward. #SOTU
I’m not willing to go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition. #SOTU
I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the tax code. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. #SOTU
We need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information—from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. #SOTU
I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. #SOTU
If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child—become a teacher. #SOTU
If we want to win the future—if we want innovation to produce jobs in America—then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. #SOTU
Tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources. #SOTU
Instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s. #SOTU
This is our generation’s Sputnik moment. #SOTU
What we can do—what America does better than anyone—is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. #SOTU
We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That’s how our people will prosper. #SOTU
We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place to do business. #SOTU
The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can’t just stand still. #SOTU
The world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us. #SOTU
Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today. #SOTU
We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. #SOTU
Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known...the economy is growing again. #SOTU
We will move forward together, or not at all—for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. #SOTU
