@seanhannity Look forward to talking w/ you about our budget reforms that protect middle class jobs & property taxpayers.
The fact that Sen Dems are still in IL shows why the legislature had to move forward to protect the middle class.

Our repair bill will save jobs, protect taxpayers, reform gov't and help balance the budget.
