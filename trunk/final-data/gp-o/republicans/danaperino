@kilmeade let's see if @KarlRove and I agree!
@EC329 welcome back beautiful hair czarina!
RT @RichardGrenell: more to pj crowleyâ€™s firing, "reading the NYT was most important part of my day" http://bit.ly/ehsmA4
Meeting back up with @foxandfriends at 7 am ET...state dept spokesman's "departure", dealing with a crises from WH level. Don't miss!
Curious to me that npr folks using same tp's about worry for rural communities (you know, ones filled w/ racists and tea party people...)
Heading over for Fox News Sunday panel - Chris Wallace has a packed show, update on Japan, plus Sen McConnell and then the panel.
To my point, from AP: Blast destroys Japan nuke plant building..Obama promotes fairness for women..Murkowski calls for more oil exploration.
RT @BetsyMTP: I have a vested interest in this reminder! MT @NBCNews: Reminder: DST begins at 2am Sunday morn. Don't forget to turn cloc ...
So it's bewildering that with all that's going on, rather than be topical, the WH topic is Paycheck Fairness Act.  Seriously?
In the pr, there's no easier way to get your message out than the potus radio address. You pick topic, get three days of good pr.
RT @kirstenpowers10: Blind man keeps his old guide dog after it loses its sight & then gets a new one who now leads them both around  ht ...
http://bit.ly/ikBVdU thank you Pete for writing this - drives me nuts these "unilateral" charges.
@EC329 erica - I'm so sorry to learn about your grandfather's passing and your grandmother's brokenheart. You are in my prayers.
RT @mkhammer: Read the tweets of the women of Tahrir Square, attacked, harrassed during yesterday's women's rally: http://bit.ly/iaAqSN
@MaureenMakeup ha! My mom would probably never believe I wanted to be in the quiet car. That would have been my punishment when I was little
@BenYurcho there's one problem with being calm in the quiet car - I'm not driven by irritation to tweet!
@stevemiller3 I find those headphones too heavy - I try every day to lighten my load but it feels like a gremlin throws rocks in my bag.
You'll be glad to know I finally was able to sit in the quiet car. No complaints today.
@RichLowry I'll bet the woman I just saw do it advocates for green energy and donates to enviro groups.
Do smokers who throw their cigarette butts in the street consider that to be littering? Good grief.
RT @JonahNRO: I remember when undercover stings are what made "60 Minutes" America's greatest journalistic enterprise. #Backinmyday
Most coverage Locke has gotten as commerce secretary was day or his announcement and day of his moving to be amb. And we're in recession.
Coming up live with @BillHemmer - talking today's senate vote on budget cuts for this year. Expect gop votes as a block, and some dems join.
Check out the new ad from American Crossroads -  http://bit.ly/fZ1YhJ
@MaureenMakeup@EC329 Ladies, so well done with the military women. Employers should snap them up. Experienced, skilled, trusted.
Is vaunted Schumer message machine malfunctioing?  Why is Reid back out in front of Schumer? Intrigue abounds.
@Stewman1965 I would say I'm not for shutting down just to make a point - shutting down if you can't get to agreement, yes.
Tonight will be back on set with Stuart Varney on @hannityshow - we'll hash out today's budget offer from Dems.
Or maybe the Dems strategy is just to keep making us wonder what their strategy is - I keep thinking maybe we just can't see the brilliance.
RT @JonahNRO: Note to NPR: Outside your offices "Muslim Brotherhood" is a red flag for many Americans. @jpodhoretz
Maybe Reid's offer of just $4.7b in cuts is part of larger ploy to make Obama look positively reasonable compared to the left.
@Unclebeano indeed! Have you heard @DierksBentley? He's a great writer.
Being a Wyoming native, I'm all for cowboy poetry - but I also think that western poets are talented enough they don't need fed gov help!
@dsmawley got one - will listen to @DierksBentley the whole way. ;)
Boarding train soon so of course have to complain - today, the Game Show Network is on with volume blasting. Guess they got tired of news
@Summitshasta Happy Birthday Eve Terry!
@EC329 @MaureenMakeup what are you two chirpin' about? See you Wednesday to find out?
Coming up on @foxandfriends at 7 am ET - on rep king's hearings, libyan response, and more...
What if GOP and Dems got along like this? Don't worry, it's g-rated - fun to show your kids this video. http://bit.ly/eYjBvA
@eaglesdontflock @420cox you're a great person for following me - thank you!
RT @amehler: @DanaPerino how about a RT for a fan and Iraq War Vet!  :)
RT @420cox: @DanaPerino will you please give a RT a HUGE fan working at the firestation today?
@JonahNRO and Muesli in your modem is just gross.
@TonyFratto Big beaks, lots of style...
@JerryDonAR tomorrow at 7 am - every monday I get to appear on @foxandfriends - see you then!
Sign at biz in virginia: "Try our Italian Chicken Free Wifi! Sounds tasty.
Ah...Take me home country roads...have missed Shenandoah National Park.
@foxdavebriggs your dignity...oh, whoops...well...shucks...
RT @TonyFratto: The teeth-gnashing over the idea of the 30-year mortgage disappearing is ridiculous.
@M_jopink certainly you mean, "win the future?" Or "wikileaks task force"? Cute dog. Vizsla?
@ByronYork That claim is soundly debunked by Keith at www.keithhennessey.com. Dangerous for staff to have your pres make claim so vulnerable
@ByronYork
Come again? From speech yesterday: "... we have transformed our foreign policy so that America is once again respected around the world."
http://bit.ly/fhIKgl Thanks to Keith Hennessey for the work on these charts - hope the media takes a look at what the WH means by "halfway"
RT @RichardGrenell: @DanaPerino 2 words - susan rice. she didn't show up for the first 2 meetings. msm is mia.
@TomJPyle @IERenergy you are correct, my mistake - bp is partner on the project...thanks for catching.
Coming up on Megyn Kelly at 2:15 pm ET - talking gas prices, energy politics, and why the #doublestandard on media coverage re potus
@InsidersGroup I am coming up with a plan - some people are incurable!
With women from around the world today at the Women Democracy Network conference. Great group! http://yfrog.com/h8135zpj
@dancurry agree. Highly unusual for a potus to appear on camera without knowing more than first reports.
@dancurry nice. You should patent that remark.
Ever get the feeling the WH is constantly trying to change the subject? I can't figure out the strategy.
@JWP4USC Sen Akaka isn't going to run again - so, folks, we've got a race!
RT @AriFleischer: I always wished Obama had named Akaka as his running-mate. Obama-Akaka had such a nice ring to it.
I just want it to be known I will relocate to Hawaii to work on the 2012 Senate race...kidding...kind of.
RT @AriFleischer: Thank you Pres Bush. Imagine Libya if Gadaffi still had his nuke weapons program. Why did he he give it up?  He feared ...
I think it's funny that it's being suggested i follow Taco Bell. I haven't eaten taco bell since i was 17.
RT @stephenfhayes: A quick point about the terrific Greg Jaffe WaPo piece: POTUS can raise awareness of Afghan war and sacrifices by tal ...
@FUBAR6ed thanks very much - about to try to explain what happens after the 2 week extension...wish I had a crystal ball.
Coming up with @BillHemmer on Fox about the Hill deal to avoid shutdown - but looking ahead, what's next after 2 weeks?
@FUBAR6ed Easy there - had not seen - apologies for oversight. Thanks for the note. D
@marysammons we're working on it Mary, @queenedix is on it. Stay tuned to my website, www.danaperinoandco.com!
@scottstanzel Quick, switch to Hannity - me and Varney coming up! #Justified
@TonyFratto oh right - decided they're inappropriate but I think it's because they are cheap.
@TonyFratto how are the death stares between poltico and nyt over the bardella scandal?
RT @AriFleischer: The NYT and POLITICO are brawling over which one leaked emails - about reporters. Please pass the popcorn! http://nyti ...
@LibertyCzarina @bluedevilmsn  #beachweek Who knew?! Thanks so much - I'll mark my calendar for next year. So long to wait.
@Shavewcs A distant memory, cookie dough. Any woman over 30 has had to give that up.
Lobsterfest, Nat'l peanut butter month...I'm looking for chips and salsa appreciation week.
@Stewman1965 was thinking that if you're a business owner, you'd go belly up if you had that much waste weighing down your company.
Tonight on @hannityshow with Stuart Varney re: new report about government waste. A report like that makes private sector cringe.
@TonyFratto whatever happened to national weeks? Now we have months...and a whole month of peanut butter celebration, well, lots of cals.
@InsidersGroup this is a big problem - agree!
@terrana01 to be clear, meant email reply to all offenders...there are many of them. Irritates me to no end.
@57MCM goodness me you are correct! 170 west 4th street! It was wonderful. Las Ramblas has a great wine list, excellent food and sercive.
Is it just me or are there more "reply to all" offenders? Those who don't reply to all when they should, & some who do when they shouldn't.
At Las Ramblas tonight on West 170th Street - Spanish tapas - wonderful place, come highly recommend from trusted source...and now me!
@Robby1M and I was wearing 3.5" heels!
With Cadet Lujan today at West Point's Million Dollar View. He graduates in May - great tour guide! http://yfrog.com/h5nkyzj
With the West Point cadets today. Great q's about politics - America's in good hands with these guys http://yfrog.com/h21skvlj
@KCHunt hey I'm with ya...it's perverse.
@MaureenMakeup @EC329 love the new photo! Ok, on to west point. Wish I was taking a class, not lecturing!
@MaureenMakeup @EC329 love the new photo - damn you look pretty! Ok, on to west point. Nearly there. Wish I was taking class, not teaching!
@foxdavebriggs - on way to west point dave...lots of dirty snow for you up here. Rain clearing it off - you better hurry.
@EC329 blushing...who knew that was what the area was known for?!
@DailyCaller I agree - we spend millions to get people not to smoke but then raise taxes on smokers...do we want revenue or better health?
@BradleyScott1 I'm your first follower...never forget that! ;)
@MaureenMakeup @EC329 now you two have that song in my head!
On way to West Point today - meeting with a couple of classes, lunch, tour of the academy. Will be honor to be with the cadets!
Coming up soon on @foxandfriends - no #oscar commentary, though...Libya, Govs making for good candidates and media #doublestandards.
