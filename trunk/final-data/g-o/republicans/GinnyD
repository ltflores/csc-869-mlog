Sarah Huckabee rocks.  She is such an asset to Huck PAC, Governor Huckabee and Team Huck.  She does a terrific job.
The more I read of the House Health Care Bill HR 3200, the more amazed I am at the chutzpah of Congress.
Bill Frist just laid out all the things wrong with Obama's health care plan in three words - socialized health care
I have read over 1/2 of the house health care bill. Believe me, you don't want to read it.  It is going to be America's nightmare if enacted
Senator Frist will be on the O'Reilly Factor tonight at 8 pm.  Tune in.  He knows more about health care than anyone else I have heard.
Just finished watching Meeting of the Minds.  Excellent program.
Senator Frist was easily the most knowledgable on Meeting of the Minds.
Senator/Dr. Bill Frist will be on CNBC at 9 PM ET on Meeting of the Minds. Be sure to watch. He knows more about health care than anyone.
I am reading the House and Senate versions of the health care bill.  Does anyone know if there are more than one in each house?
Listening to Obama's plans for our country is enough to make me ill.
Governor Huckabee made a lot of sense with his commentary about doctors and what they make.
I am learning new things every day.

Hey Huck PAC Oregon.  Glad to see you on Twitter.
Can someone explain why we have such an incompetent Congress?
President Obama has left a lot to be desired in his first two months

wondering when Republicans are going to come up with a plan and a call to action!!
Is wondering when the Nashville Post is going to get a political columnist?
Senator Frist's commentary about President Bush saving 10 million lives was on the money.
President Bush's speech of last night was one of the strongest speeches he has made.
I still support Chip Saltsman for RNC Chair
Merry Christmas to everyone!!
I have never been able to figure out whether to laugh at Kleinhelder or feel sorry for him
