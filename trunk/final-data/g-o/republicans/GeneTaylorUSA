@Rxrthepoet   If that's what you think will defeat them in 2012.  I think name calling (accurate or otherwise) turns independents the off.
@Rxrthepoet  That's true. I'm not the enemy. I agree with your goals. I was merely suggesting a MORE PRODUCTIVE tactic to defeat them.
@Rxrthepoet  You're right. Let's waste time turning off the independents who decide elections by focusing on BRANDING.  My bad.
@scarlett_0hara  Nope. I'd rather focus on DEFEATING them than arguing about WHO THEY ARE. It's counterproductive.

@EmOwnsMyHeart  Just out of curiosity, do you have the ability to make an intelligent statement, or do you just rail & make threats?
@EmOwnsMyHeart  People who brag about their IQ are either insecure, liars or both. I think YOU'RE BOTH. All you can do is make idle threats.
