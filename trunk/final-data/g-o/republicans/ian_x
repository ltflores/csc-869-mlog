@ronxo Just misuse it until it's destroyed. Let's go w "fat man belly-button". As in, "I had so much lint in my man cave, I found a Cheeto."
If you think tragedies killing thousands of people are messages from God, I say you've lost touch w/ the value of life. http://bit.ly/icXa43
It's great to see @matthewdowsmith's NIGHT FOLK doing so well. Over a third of the way there! http://kck.st/eqHEGn
Week Two progress update on @matthewdowsmith's Kickstarter for his novel NIGHT FOLK - http://kck.st/gYcgBN
Got my NYCC Artist Alley application and Pro registration in today.
@ErikJLarsen It's a tough balance to achieve.
@sispurrier Now we can all die happy. Good timing there.
RT @drhastings: Oh my God, Marvel pays you in checks with SPIDER-MAN ON THEM. I love this job.
@ChrisEliopoulos Maybe it was intentional. Call it a "Chinatown Horse Head".
@JamesCShooter Your latest blog was eye-opening. Thank you for your bravery, not keeping the more unpleasant truths in the dark.

RT @anneisNOTdead: Oh $#%&! I have to clean this place up-- I'm being followed by @ChrisStaros at TopShelf. No pressure.
RT @anneisNOTdead: Okay, that's creepy. Someone's messing with me. Who changed my username to "anneisdead"? Fixing that now!
My friend @mjbrenner won the DM's Challenge at #PAX this weekend! His group rated him "6 out of 5". I playtested, and he deserved it! #dnd
.@sesamestreet  Ah-ha-ha!

It was cool seeing a comics showing from @OniPress and @Udon at #PAX East this weekend. Also met @Zubkavich and grabbed Skullkickers v1!
RT @Zubkavich: It was an exhausting weekend, but PAX East was a success! Great crowd, crazy times. We fought and won! #PAX #UDON #YAY

Made it back to #PAX. Sitting down in tabletop to eat my lunch and get my bearings. Anyone around? #fb
Heading to Cheeseboy at South Station-- grilled cheese == comfort
Girl on train tells her friends she doesn't care about compliments. Then immediately asks her friend about her make-up to elicit complement.
Wow. Just got ditched by a half dozen friends. Nice.
@VampyBitme Are you at #PAX East?

Anyone else in the upstairs waiting area outside the main theatre at #PAX?
In the Keynote line-- you don't need to wait downstairs. Third floor main theatre, above main entrance. #PAX

@JenniferLMeyer Nope. I just leave 'em in the freezer. :D

Anyone who knows stories (and comics) want to read a story outline and tear it apart nicely?
I've noticed that @matthewdowsmith can draw the hell out of paper blowing around. Which I assume represents that state of his studio.

RT @MARTlNSHEEN: Charlie thought he pissed blood today but the doctor said that's what excellence looks like.  #winning
RT @MARTlNSHEEN: It was less embarrassing when he was high.
I think the challenge is more clear now. The story is still a heist, which changes how overcoming it is presented, though. Hmm.
At least it's better to work out something like that while still outlining. heh
This is a perfectly good outline, except the story doesn't feel like it has enough of a challenge for the protagonist. Hrmph.
@gliovampire You're too kind!
@matthewdowsmith @philhester Check again Matt. You did just turn 40.
@philhester @themikenorton @kmellon Can I be your friend? I have a terrible ass.

If you RT one of those, pick the first one not the terrible joke. ;)
Every time @matthewdowsmith signs off of twitter from now on, he should say NIGHT, FOLKS! http://kck.st/hZI19T

@onegemini Oooh. Cool!
@onegemini Usually a "webinar" is one part advertising opportunity. So they only want the discount to go to people who heard their pitch.
@gliovampire Valia said she would talk to you, to work out how many to send. :)
RT @ColleenCoover: New post: World's Finest http://bit.ly/h6mN9j
I have friends in England, Scotland, Italy, Greece, and all over the USA. I wish I could spend time with you all!
@valium_ I wish we could afford the flight and the time off! I've never been to Greece, it's so sad. :(
@valium_ YAY!!!
RT @ShitMagnetoSays: "So you like drugs and powers. That's the mustard and mayo on a hero sandwich. Problem is, that's all you've got on ...
@valium_ Omnomnomnom, indeed. I want souvlaki and greek coffee and lemon-chicken soup and galaktabouriko and and and and!
@valium_ @gliovampire Ooh! yay! Having a table is fun. Do you want any more extra copies to sell at the table?
@valium_ Do you want them all signed? :)
@valium_ Sorry it took so long. I kept running out of copies, and then shipping was more expensive than I guessed. All set now though!
@valium_ @gliovampire Will you guys have a table at Bristol, or just walking around?
@valium_ It will be 8 of Black Label Comics #1, plus 2 of the Ltd. Edition, plus 3 of The Deathlings. Is that right? :)
@valium_ I'm packing your box of comics right now. (I finally have comics, the box, and money to send them all the way to Greece!)
@valium_ @gliovampire OHH! I thought it was this weekend. LOL. Valia will definitely have her copies in time!
@gliovampire @valium When does the convention start? I have them ready to mail out, but I think it takes 3-4 days even Priority Mail.
@valium_ Greece is tiny, but it's all islands and mountains. I'm surprised trains work out so well there. heh
@valium_ Ahhh. No, America is terrible at public transport. Everyone drives or flies everywhere. (Because the country is so big I guess?)
@valium_ We have some trains. Mostly light rail in cities, only a few cross-country routes.
@gliovampire Yay!
@LadyGreentea Another genius idea: Make croissants. Instead of baking, deep-fry. Add cinnamon and sugar. Voila, Croissant-Dunuts!
@LadyGreentea INSANITY! I want one.
Designed (my character is researching) a new #DND Utility power called "Concussive Maintenance". Wizard Blacksmith FTW. Hope it passes.
@amezri Oh man, I want those!
@gliovampire I hope so!! I'll be at Boston (April 30), Baltimore (August), and New York (October) this year! :D
@DocDestiny Ah. You should be all set then.
@DocDestiny Won't being in Bristol make the Med and Sun parts of that difficult? ;)
@DocDestiny Isn't that the goal? I know that's how I live my life. heh
@jdaysy I'll be sure to have some extra fun on your behalf! ;)
@johnhornor I did basically the opposite yesterday-- Because today is my Friday this week. heh
@jdaysy Ohhh-- I get it now. Heh.
@jdaysy "5 angles"?
@DocDestiny On the other hand, you'd have an excuse to talk to editors-- Dropping off a sample. ;)
@DocDestiny @gliovampire @valium_ Cool! Everyone say Hi to each other for me! ;) I wish I had sent you comics copies in time!!
Okay, aside from me, @mjbrenner, and @DrSlashblight who else in my Twittersphere is going to #PAXEast?
@DrSlashBlight Okay-- Catch up with you in the afternoon then! :)
