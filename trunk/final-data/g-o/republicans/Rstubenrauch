@commcounsel I don't even know what you're obviously mocking with this tweet.
@JonathanGormley you should really stop tweeting about Arsenal. It seems to backfire.
Snow/ice is coming down hard north of Columbus. I predict angry weather tweets from @ohiocapitalblog
Thanks to @mogotti2 for all the heart, good luck with Griffin. @cavsdan looks serious with the rebuilding effort. Go Cavs!

Braylon gets blown out...hope Steelers get smoked by the Packers.

Point taken. RT @ChasRunco I preferred LLLLLLLoyd Carr, at least he made the games worth watching.
@ChasRunco What are you talking about? Rich Rod was a blessing to tOSU! Maybe scUM finally figured out that he was a plant?

@mattdole Canadians would be offended too (it's not a hockey record). Deport to Greenland?
Really Big Ten?!  Leaders Division and Legends Division? Just go with A and B.
This #NoLabels thing just sounds like another Jon Stewart ploy.
Unfollowing @PDcavsinsider I've finally had enough tweets about the lack of Wi-Fi and uninteresting facts I can get from the boxscore.
@commcounsel If #iFad buyers will buy iFad2 with only a camera upgrade then Apple should consider selling boxed air.

@johnkhall Novel argument But Katz deals with 4th amend and profiling allegedly violates 14th amend(treating 1 race differently than others)
@rightohio Good example, courts require silly things like stopping random cars, etc.I guess that's why a 3 y/o gets a strip search at LAX.
@johnkhall Katz doesn't mean illegal searches r ok if u know about them @RightOhio profiling is an equal protection problem not 4th amend.
