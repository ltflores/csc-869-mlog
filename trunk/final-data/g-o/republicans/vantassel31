RT wrote an article on servant leadership in Washington. Check it out, let me no your thoughts. http://budurl.com/xbg7 #obama #healthcare
The clintons r like the pig flu, they never go away.
Servant leadrshp is what we expect out of r leadrs in Washington. In a representative republic, the leadrs serve the people, not vise versa.

3000 record low temperatures were set in July. I suppose we must blame this on global warming...
"My interest is not in getting btwn U & ur dr... We want 2 start rewarding drs for quality not just the quantity of care that they provide"
#Obama Healthcare isnt a right if the government can take it away. Your plan does just that. Read the travesty of a bill and see 4 yourself.

Replace income tax with national sales tax. Save gvt billions, give every1 more purchasing power, watch econ soar. welcm 2 Common Sense, USA
Term limits for Congress would go a long way in getting government out of our lives and getting lobbyists and corruption out of Washington.

Obama, why don't U appologize for our meddling in WW1 and WW2 and all the freedom our brave men and women have enabled around the world. GAG

Similarities between God and Obama: God doesn't have a birth certificate either.

@DEMOCRATZxORG I do believe tax cuts help the poor and middle class, something the Dems are constantly opposing.
What's the difference between God & Obama? God doesn't think he is Obama.
which is better, to leave your posititon in capable hands when taking the next step or do nothing but run for the next highest office?

@Guissou the UN is incompitent. (sp?). ;-)
@kaliforce Reagan was pretty aggressive. "Mr Gorbachov, tear down this wall!" the more pressure on Achmadinijad and the mullahs the better.
