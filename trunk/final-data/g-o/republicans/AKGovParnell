"Alaska stands ready to create jobs, improve our nation’s energy security, our economy and our national security."
"Alaska is one of America’s key storehouses of petroleum, and many other natural resources."
"We do know that more domestic oil production—not less—better secures our nation and grows jobs at home."
"Interior and EPA are driving U.S. foreign policy b/c they are driving greater dependence on foreign oil at great cost to Americans."
"EPA received about a $3B increase in its budget last year, producing 42 “significant” regulations w/ a negative annual impact of $100M+"
"The Department of Interior in the past few years has acted like a shopaholic with a stolen credit card."
"Alaska’s oil patch is NOT dry. Far from it. It contributes 11 percent of national oil production."
"Americans’ tax bill to secure Middle East oil estimated at $7.3T over the past 3 decades-1/2 size of our nat'l debt. "
From Speech: "...our economic recovery is completely dependent on access to secure, affordable energy."
From Speech: "This is the moment our fed gov't must re-examine its policy when it comes to oil exploration and development here at home."
My speech at National Press Club in DC at 12pm ET will be available live on C-SPAN3: http://www.c-span.org/Live-Video/C-SPAN3/
