RT @Bitmob: Mobcast 96 (w/ @greenspeak, @ninjaharlot, & Pete Franco): Indie games, microtransactions, Facebook, & more! http://ow.ly/4ehxz
@alex_navarro Well the good thing is that if they use the first game as a model, we won't see it until 2050!
@hilarygoldstein I'm in!
@mainev3nt It got frozen that way, just like my mom and teachers warned me.
Discovered that sometime within the last year @gamespite became the most dapper man in game journalism. No Spaghetti-O stains or anything!
Hangin' with my Out of the Game pals @shawnelliott and @ncroal at PAX East. I appear more excited than those two. http://twitpic.com/49goc7
@LessStealth I use 6 buttons myself!
@tyjroberts how about you get them to throw a chuzzle for the first pitch?
Hands on with the 3DS at PAX made me think maybe I want one after all. But I worry the initial wow factor will fade. Gameplay is still king.
@TheChrisAbbott thanks for the drink, man! Fun talking with ya!
@JamesStevenson at E3 we will totally make out!
@jamesmielke actually it was only available at dentists offices next to the Highlights.
Saw Guild Wars 2 at show and it made me want to play, even though it seems like we wrote about it 100 years ago at CGW. #coolstorybro
@spezz good talking with ya!
@maver1ck89 @jeffgerstmann @alex_navarro *calling my lawyers*
@andrewpfister how did I not see you this whole weekend? My heart, it bleeds. #not really #okmaybealittle
And sincere and humble thanks to everyone who came up and said nice things, bought me drinks, whatever.  I really appreciated it, kidz!
Had a fantastic time at PAX East. I love each and every one of you. Yes, in that way.
Oy vey. My head. #PaxEast
@Syllver @dhaelis awesome! Thanks for the pics!!
@Theologian78 no one gave a damn!
"thank you for gfw radio, cuz it has helped me fall asleep many nights." You're welcome!
It's 3:45 am and I am at the most crowded Chinese restaurant ever. Also I broke my glasses. #PaxEast
Awesome time at the giantbomb party. Thanks to @taswell @jeffgerstmann and gang for being such awesome hosts and cool dewds.
Gonna be swinging by 1up meetup at whiskey priest tonite for happy fun times!
Dungeon Siege 3 looks pretty freakin sweet!
@TheChrisAbbott that's where we are too :)
This is what appears when I turn on my hotel TV.  http://t.co/GZMF6w4
@Teanah yes. Felt party. See u tomorrow. :)
@Teanah dude. Just be glad you're not here. ask no questions.
@Ecksorcism lol ouch :D
@KimAms okay. Got it. Will start stripping. Thank you!
@KimAms are you telling me to take a photo with the strippers?
@loudERIC hopefully next time! <3 those guys!
At this juncture, in which sweaty gamers are now taking photos w/strippers, it crosses my mind that I may indeed be too old for this shit.
This party is like Jersey Shore with Batman tshirts.
@darkwhitehair not this year :(
I am now at a very loud party with a VIP badge on, but have no idea who these people are or why I'm here. #bewilderedoldguy
@tole_cover yay! Thanks!
@Samanthix totally miss you! We need to get together, yo!
And if ya want to say hi to me, come find me around the console freeplay area, pushing popcap drugs to children!
First day at PAX = massive fun! Sorry for the lack of twitter updates--the internetz hated me today!
Did I miss the 1up meetup? Hey @teanah, holla at ya dad.
@RiggenBlaque I'm around console freeplay area with popcap. No panels for me this time!
reception is for shit at PAX! Twitter ability, borked!
@ninjaharlot backatcha, Ms Harlot! A fine time indeed!
Here's my hotel mini bar! #WTF #areyouserious #ohthehumanity  http://t.co/xjjvOTO
@christilton totally. Dude shoulda just lifted off, passed everyone in the air, then cut back down again. I would have!
Photo taken in-flight. The person reading a book in the foreground kinda ruins the "pod people" caption in my head. http://t.co/iYkw6jR
@JamesLeffler we've landed! Just tryin to get off now! :)
Apparently there's a "traffic jam" of planes on the ground. WTF, pilot! Let's see some road rage! Just plow the fuck ahead and honk! #USA
@Pixel_Kaiser *fist bump*
@xpeetahx not this time!
Been sitting on runway in Boston for 15 mins. Capt just said 10 more mins.  Mutiny is afoot. May join party to storm peanut supply.
@ahroni get me an invite!
RT @popcap_games: We'll be handing out these PvZ bumper stickers at PAX East! For those who aren't going, I'm giving away a few today! h ...
@myketuna that just draws attention to the fact that I'm not strong enough. I'm trying to be discreet.
@OutlandishMatt thank you :)
Been struggling with this "easy open" pack of crackers on this flight for an hour. Apparently I need to go to the gym more.
@CesarQuintero get a car, you hoodlum!
@csanberg so far so good..but still early yet. His writing is as strong as ever though!
Between inflight wifi, Wise Man's Fear, Tactics Ogre on my PSP, satellite TV, and The Shield on my iPad, I need this flight to be 300 hours.
@halowitz sure did! :)
Three neckbeards and now one mandolin.
@badrockjones haha :) will do if I can! Not sure if I'm doing popcappy stuff yet tonite!
Count is three neckbeards on this flight so far. Only one is female.
@DanUNG @davidellis see? It pays to be an aging wizard!
@DavidEllis :( coming from me, it's doubly insulting. Hugs?
@TheChrisAbbott I'll be at the console freeplay room a lot and also wandering around. Look for the bewildered old man!
@giordanobc the senior demographic is important. Also, being closer to death gives me much-needed perspective on games like Limbo.
RT @giordanobc: Everyone going to Pax East seems to be 20 years old or less. That's why we're sending @greenspeak - balance is key
@DavidEllis ipad, doofus!
@Rolyatkcinmai @taswell I think they have security specifically banning me this year. #sadtrombone
Dude next to me at SFO cafe drinking a bigass beer at 9:25 am. #likeaboss
Priority security line FTW. On my way to PAX East, nerdlings!
@NAPPSTER13 yeah the actual score by Hans Zimmer. It's fantastic.
@kasavin @supergiantgames so awesome! Huge congrats, man. Game looked amazing last time I saw it.
Knowing I'm being followed by @RealCapnCrunch is a new career milestone. Hi Cap'n! Thanks for the awesome cereal! My dentist thanks you too!
Listening to Inception soundtrack on crowded BART train makes me feel like we're all gonna be in a lot of trouble.
RT @Sxeptomaniac: @Greenspeak Cap'n Crunch ain't dying or changing, even.  It was all bogus rumors. He's going to Facebook, though. http ...
It is amazing to me how one tiny dog can snore so loud. http://t.co/ZCJFB2W
Packing for PAX, but also making reservations for my first ever trip to Shanghai in April! Wewt!
@guybers A bunch of us are going to be in the console freeplay room, hosting Bejeweled Blitz Live 1-on-1 matches. Easiest way to find us!
@eznark I have no idea why @sportsguy33 's father hates me.  I've always loved his son's columns.  And I follow him on Twitter! Harrumph.
Thanks to @LouPetridish for this. The Capn's Last Supper: http://yfrog.com/h0r3nxvj #savecapncrunch
@MrPope @JOHNTDRAKE Oh sure.  That's just what they want us to believe, so that the plebes and townies don't visit!
@LouPetridish hahaha.  That's awesome. Kinda like The Last Supper, huh?
@garywhitta EXACTLY.  Clearly a failure, and a fraud.
@jason_wilson It makes your yogurt healthy, yes.
@NT_ I know! It's interfering with my ranting though!
Since I'm heading to Boston for PAX anyway, maybe I need to pay that "health expert" at Yale visit. CAP'N CRUNCH SAYS HELLO.  BOOM.
Great. There's a quote from some "health" "expert" at Yale saying how it's "good thing" Cap'n Crunch is being retired.  Academics = morons!
I still have scars on the roof of my mouth from decades ago, eating Cap'n Crunch. They can't take those away from me, the bastards!
@BenjaminBirdie #savecapncrunch
@the_unabomber @ShaneWatch Yummy Mummy has some kinda weird MILF connotation.  Or maybe that's just me.
@NSSteph Dude. Now is not the time to split apart into splinter cereal groups. That is how they win! We must band together! #savecapncrunch
@ShaneWatch I never even heard of that cereal. I guess that comes from CommieLand, where people don't like Cap'n Crunch!
@ShaneWatch COMMUNIST
Why is Cap'n Crunch not trending?!  This is like the day Lennon died. Okay, probably too soon for that. My bad. Still: #savecapncrunch
@badrockjones In tomorrow night, yes!
