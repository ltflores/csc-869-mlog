@allyjweir i tweeted about them this weekend sir.
So prey 2 is idtech5, right? That seems like the underlying implication of their press release.
@vsrobot well, he apologized at least. it's more than i can say for any of the others i've seen.
@vsrobot name?
oh god, this episode of californication is fucking PAINFUL.
@BenKuchera [redacted].
i think it's important as a games writer to play bad games sometimes, especially when it isn't for a review. good perspective.
@mudron it is seriously impossible to find good quality imagery of mucha (or any other nouveau artist) online, that i'm aware of.
i caved and just dropped a hundred bucks on mucha books. I REGRET NOTHING.
@fiddlecub how is your shape? i was super disappointed in active 2.0 with kinect.
@AbdulBCRT yep.
i hate starting the morning off like this, but prepare to lose all interest in black mesa source: http://is.gd/C5tZ1D
how did i just now realize that the british lieutenant in inglourious basterds was also stelios in 300? and now's he's goddamn magneto.
@sterling_m right? the tension in the second half of the movie is razor sharp.
@iLevi uhhh, as soon as i am able, because i've never been and i hear it's awesome?
ah fuck most of my good pencils are at the office.
@mudron http://is.gd/UckN0K, http://is.gd/G8TMBx, http://is.gd/6ezHRB
@fullbright as game tees go, that one's actually pretty slick. teensy bit jealous.
@MitchyD this is on amazon. i might hit up some bookstores tomorrow before i finalize my order.
i am about to spend way, WAY too much money on books on Alphonse Mucha.
@DavidEllis are you also in the mood to send some townies to the hospital?
today's internal rollercoaster has been soundtracked by The Joy Formidable: http://youtu.be/a2BUEzdjfpY failure + shoegaze + girl singer.
ah! correction re: sad panda: rt @nmillions @aegies we've run correction on date of photo: MAy 2008 in China.
oh. wow. RT @joshsternberg: Post-earthquake, terrified giant panda grabs  policeman's legs: http://bit.ly/goy0fE (via @nmillions)
@_Stahlbrand_ it's capable of features in the dx11 subset. tessellation in particular is a "big deal" thing.
@moonlet ..................EWWWWWWWWWWWW.
at this point faster than real time video encoding of 1080p, h264 video is enough, i suppose.
@stereoscreamer rip using anydvd hd, package with makemkv - for blu-ray, straight to xvid4psp>m2ts, for hd-dvd a couple more steps.
@nemesisN1derboy vans!
@ohMegaman i'm not at PAX.
@miladesn for whatever reason, the 360 refuses to place mp4 files with 5.1 soundtracks, and the ps3 chokes on them over a network.
@felliniflex probably not. they want you to buy their devices, or licensed devices.
@Scott_Bromley blu-ray quality video streaming from your pc to your 360 or ps3? is that more digestible?
@miladesn if you have windows 7, you can use media center extender with 360. why not do it?
@dotmoe i've had serious playback issues in other formats with lower bitrates. you might try remuxing a couple of files with m2ts.
@dotmoe unknown. maybe not on 360? the wireless cards are limited by the 360's USB bandwidth caps.
and for everyone else, that last tweet was a wall of gibberish. sorry!
for the av nerds out there: the 360 and ps3 can play back 1080p 5.1 files without issue in the .m2ts format. m2ts supports avchd and vc-1.
@TotallyEpic i have a ton of hd-dvds that say otherwise.
@TotallyEpic eh. i have around 4TB of storage.
@Scott_Bromley nah, that guy from short circuit would get all up in my grill.
holy shit. just cracked the hd-dvd rip issue. 1080p and 5.1 streamed perfectly with virtually lossless video in 360 MCE.
@D3stiny_Sm4sher nope. i'm in the bay area. there are pictures.
there are booth babes at PAX East. fantastic.
sometimes it's really helpful to play a terrible game after you played a really great game to give the proper perspective.
@sp8des it's complicated for twitter but i'm sure @sterling_m or myself could explain next time one of us bumps into you : /
@sp8des nein. ethical issues.
@agentbizzle and @scott_bromley have conspired to give you podcancer with this week's Rebel FM: http://is.gd/vq6vXm
RT @Morielia: It's my dream to move somewhere where people care about other people and not just themselves.
death toll from pearl harbor was around 5k. death toll from hiroshima approx. 160k, nagasaki 80k.
if we "needed payback for pearl harbor" i'm pretty sure we already fucking covered that: http://is.gd/lWH3KW
previous tweet was in response to http://is.gd/2FHTyd, via @shawnelliot.
i'm pretty sure japan offered aid and assistance after both 9/11 and hurricane katrina, you fucking idiots.
@dylbob @Chufmoney's cat does that without any help from me.
taking a much needed day off today to catch up on cleaning, both of my room/apartment and my brain.
@MitchyD dm me a name!
RT @MRSallee: (Twitter ruined that picture, let's try again.) San Francisco coastline at 9:00 AM from Skyline Blvd. http://bit.ly/f76q5i
@thomasrpowers it has been for a couple of years now. kinect is profitable, and they're selling a good amount of software.
i've dealt with earthquakes before, but this is my first tsunami warning. crazy.
@sp8des @sterling_m how is anyone going to play the darkness when you're beating asses at epic's booth?
RT @agentbizzle: also, oh hey i'm on Rebel FM tonight with @Scott_Bromley. miss me bitches?
Xbox 360 sold 535k for the month of February. Highest non holiday month ever. That's more 360s than the month Halo 3 released.
@Morielia eh.
@Mike_landis wait, what?
you should. tis cool. RT @sp8des: come check out  The Darkness II at PAX East at Booth #950 for a worldwide exclusive first hands-on!
This isn't the game in question, but I thought Bulletstorm's score was quite good, as an example.
I'm not sure what it says when I'm shocked that a shooter has a fantastic soundtrack.
welp, looks like i'm finally buying a ps+ membership at some point.
@betajames as someone who has dated outside of my ethnicity more often than not, i can say the comment about "no one noticing" is bullshit.
@Rydog atrix?
Too much going on for shitty hotel internet.
@MRSallee those things are kind of mutually exclusive, at least with lcds.
@MRSallee that depends on what's most important to you. For me, it was input lag/control latency for games.
shadows of the damned preview written. now it's time to sleep on it and edit a bit more tomorrow morning.
@snakpakk success!
@snakpakk "just go with the usual stuff maybe. dark and ominous. like losing your penis is a bad thing."
forgetting sarah marshall is much more sharply written than it's given credit for.
@sanzeebury i did. i wrote a preview about it a couple of weeks ago on @ign. they're good!
@sterling_m i look forward to stories of her wrecking fools come april with the beta.
found out last week while checking out the darkness II that @sp8des is way harder core about gears than you. and probably me.
hey weather, if you could not rain right when i'm getting ready to run, that would be totally tits.
@fiddlecub i think streamlining in the interest of letting me get to the good parts is fine. too many games cling to genre conventions.
i hate feeling like a publisher is trying to pull a fast one on me.
@SamitSarkar this doesn't have anything to do with shadows
i don't think i've ever explained so much about tessellation in  my life.
this shadows of the damned preview needs appropriate music.... alright. Broken it is.
@sanzeebury ie9 and chrome are much faster in every application i've tried.
will firefox 4 not be a slow, bloated, memory leaking piece of crap? cause that would be nice.
@chespace Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea was the last PJ Harvey record I truly loved.
@k4el that would be a relief!
@jason_wilson because i've paid for it once? and even with that, the user experience is vastly superior.
@hilarygoldstein the good news is it gives Pam a chance to be awesome more often.
@jeffgerstmann i just dealt with that exact problem on friday.
@sterling_m @MitchyD yeah. i also just dropped about 700 bucks to upgrade my computer to current tech levels. fucking technology.
@sterling_m nope. 2009 40GB. so i'm not clinging to backwards compatibility.
@sterling_m i'm on 360 number 11.
@sterling_m can i not just pop it from one system to another?
@sterling_m honestly, there's so little i keep on it that i wouldn't be crushed if something did happen.
so multiple people are tweeting that my ps3 is knocking on the YLOD door. i find this surprising, given how often i use this thing.
@athedrivein yes. you can also reassociate your new system with all of your content online. just go into account management/download history
