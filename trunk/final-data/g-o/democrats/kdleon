The budget is a moral document, a reflection of our values. The reeps opp to a big oil tax to help our kids and aged is beyond cruel.
Republicans opposing oil severance tax-begs the question, why are we 1 of 22 oil producing states that does NOT tax oil producers!
In budget conference committee and about to discuss and move oil severance tax to help with budget deficit. Est. savings $1 billion.
The Gov wants to ELIMINATE UC's Early Academic Outreach, Puente, and Mesa projects today at budget conf committee -- I will fight for it!
Yesterday we voted on conference committee to eliminate the gov's secretary of education position and move him into gov's office.
About to go into Joint Budget conference committee. Today's topics will be public safety and natural resources. Gov wants ALL cuts-not real
In the Assembly chamber right now listening to the governor. His message: make ALL cuts and raise no revenue. What about the children??
