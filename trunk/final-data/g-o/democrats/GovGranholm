Unless Congress acts, unemployment benefits for more than 181,000 Michigan workers will end between now and April 30.
The impact on MI would be an estimated 26k fewer jobs.  And ending UI benefits will stretch our social safety net to the breaking point.
Letting millions of jobless Americans fall further into hardship by not extending benefits will hurt our national economic recovery.
