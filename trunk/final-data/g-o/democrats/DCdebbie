@Roy1956 it was how I was raised by my catholic mom.
RT @darrenpardee: @DCdebbie As Bill Hicks would say, I've decimated entire civilizations in an old gym sock.
The Catholic Church forbids masturbation because it kills "life."  How many "pro-life" Republican leaders would support THAT ban?
RT @IAmDrTiller: Miss Illinois says: #ihadanabortion. And I say: speak your truth! we love and support you. http://ow.ly/4elfK #prochoice

@muttmutt no link, I met these priests when I worked at the Feminist Majority in Southern California.
Before Roe v Wade, some priests in Calif helped women access to safe abortions bc they were sick of seeing them die of back alley abortions
My mom used to say if she was pro-choice I wouldn't exist. I'd tell her that mayb I'd be in a better place that way. We now agree 2 disagree
Perhaps the people who "regret" having an abortion and want to stop this choice for others should be forced to adopt a child?
RT @RL_Miller: .@dcdebbie I'm an adopted child. I probably wouldn't exist if my birth mother had a choice. And I'm still pro-choice.
"I've had several abortions... and now I'm pro-life" So it was okay for YOU to have an abortion, but nobody else can now? #BadLogic

@pcm73 he's a problem when I'm living next door to him. He loves to harass me.
Is it a bad sign when you see an exboyfriend in public and he runs away?

Just ran into next door neighbor of my condo in DC. He threatened my life once, came to my door w a gun years ago. I was in WashPo about him
