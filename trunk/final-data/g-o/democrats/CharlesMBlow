I'll be interviewed tomorrow by C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb for his Q & A program.  Whole hour about me.  Makes me a bit nervous. :-)
@BigDawgAudi Fine. Tired.
Morning Joe done!
Oh, apparently he has worked in the private sector in London as well as been a diplomat there.
Why does the Japanese ambassador to the U.S. have what sounds like a British accent?  I must Google...
Scheduled to be in MSNBCs Morning Joe tomorrow from 6-8 a.m. EST.  Tune in if you can.
@Whisper_Dharma So true. "Obama promised to "walk on that picket line" if workers r denied the right to bargain" http://tinyurl.com/4jbyanx
@Whisper_Dharma @AndrewKroll @Rima_Regas Exactly.  Hypocrisy then and now.
Love this! "Ronald Reagan: Collective Bargaining = Freedom" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn28oayX31Y (via @Rima_Regas)

@CorporateDem I went to Grambling!

@probert06 No, I was channeling the way others responded to my daughters curly hair vs. her straight hair.
@FrenchieGlobal That is a very real thing.  I once considered writing a column about how hair/lack of swimming was drowning hazard.
@probert06 My fondness?
@PinkPeonies Great line in that film: women says (paraphrasing) "how is it revolutionary to wear my hair the way it grows out of my head?"
But, with her natural curly hair my daughter is free to play and swim and run in the rain.  Must have been terribly oppression not to.
There is something deeply emotional (something I don't understand) about long, straight hair – If you can do it, it's almost a sin not to.
The hair thing is deeply cultural...my daughter used to wear her hair straight.  When she started fencing, she stopped. Relatives freaked.
@DanFriedman81 True.
@DanFriedman81 People who grow fruits and vegetables are farmers too.
@tuleesha No.  Grammar rules rule!
Lastly (and this is a touchy one) hairstyles contribute to female obesity - refusal to sweat out an expensive do with exercise.
@drschroe If you want sugary drinks to cost more, stop subsidizing crops that make high fructose corn syrup cheap.
@KBDPHD I would much rather see gov redirect subsidies to make healthy options cheaper.
Dangerous neighborhoods also make kids fat: parents keep them inside to keep them safe; they get less exercise from running around outside.
@jmittell So true.
@epaulnet Maybe, but at least direct more subsidies to farmers who grow fruit and veggies.  Now there are almost none.
@amhill That could be the result of palette training - research has shown that high-fat, high-calorie diets are as addictive as heroin
And, gym membership are expensive and gyms generally aren't located in poor neighborhoods anyway.
Also, I hate how people chalk up obesity completely to poor choices. Many poor people simply find the cheapest source of the most calories.
...compare to only 4% of school with 21-49 percent minority in enrollment who had no recess for 1st graders.
And the result have been worst for minority kids: 14% of school w/ 50+ percent minorities had no recess for 1st graders...
Also, No Child Left Behind may be contributing to childhood obesity:  since passed, 20% of school districts have cut recess by 50 mins/week.
@hillarykwiatek True.
@MagentaRocks government
Hate that I didn't have space to discuss gov culpability in making us fat: misdirecting subsidies so that Twinkies cost less than carrots.
BTW, that chart is supposed to be (and will be) in color.

@rolandsmartin I believe that when we blindly hue to an ideology we do damage to ourselves and the health of that ideology.
