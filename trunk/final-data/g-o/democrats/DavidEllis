Feeling Defiant? First digit is missing.  http://yfrog.com/h2j6ynnj
Hotel doorman just referenced "Deep Thoughts" by Jack Handy. Think that qualifies as winning.
@thisdustin That's because they haven't been released yet. :)
@ShadowPraxis Good to finally meet today you today.
@ninjaharlot Geeks are self-aware of themselves. Nerds are not.
@JazzMX5 Clearly you haven't keep up on that particular story. :)
This tweet brought to you by Edge: the savior of constant connection & battery life at techie trade shows. #DoingItRight
@Greenspeak Wish we could have chatted for more than a minute. Next time. Fly safe.
@louiethecat I hate you.
@Andyb0y Still here. Come by & say hi.
@ShadowPraxis Room 102.
@thisdustin I'd say that's a distinct possibility.
@Hypertrooper @JamesStevenson @Flipyap Ha ha ha. Well played.
For those asking YES we will be filming today's tournament for @HaloWaypoint.
Today, it's on. Halo Reach Defiant Map Tournament. Room 102 - 1-5pm.  http://yfrog.com/hs71rupj
Zzzzzzzzzzz #ThatIsAll #PAXEast
Attention #PAXEast folks @ncsuduncan is looking fir a couple teammates in the Halo Reach Defiant Tournament. Room 102 from 1-5pm.
@andrewpfister Yep, it's time to start a fight. Bet they bleed before I do.
Now "She's Like the Wind" is playing on the radio in this cab. #FML
Fuck yeah! #YankeesWin  http://t.co/FviCukm
@Kusanagi2k5 Ubisoft couldn't afford to rent out the entire club so there was a contingent of Jersey Shore types with PAX folks.
Frag doll party sucked. Trying to split a club between PAX & Boston people is huge fail.
In the mood to yell, "Go Yankees" at this Boston bar.
RT @andrewpfister: Pretty sure Cheri Oteri is tending bar at the Hilton, stuck in character.
@DMZilla Ha ha, that's their natural demeanor.
@majornelson Thanks for having me on. Gonna have to get you on the 343 Sparkast soon.
RT @majornelson: Tonight's @PaxEast show is now available. Hear the crew + @DavidEllis @therealcliffyb @HarmonixSean and more: http://mj ...
@Raurgm Breathtaking.
Why is Celine Dion playing on a loop at this restaurant?
RT @scott_343: In the Internet age it's kind of cool not be able to locate something.
As I rush over to dinner with @alisonst @bsangel @GrimBrotherOne & others I realize that my phone battery won't make it through the night.
Thanks again to @majornelson & co. for letting me cameo on their podcast. Amazing crowd. #PAXEast
Epic crowd pouring in to @majornelson's podcast recording. Thanks @thevowel @stepto & @lauralollipop for letting me crash for a bit.
@arnemeyer It's a metagame James is participating in all weekend.
@puptastrophe I'll do better next time. Promise.
RT @alisonst: Twelve, thirteen, fourteen.. So serene. http://twitpic.com/48uta7 #Utilicount
I think I can feel an aneurism moving it's way through my head. #PAXLite
"Give up on your dreams. Someone else has already done it better." #PAXLite #NotTrue
RT @hsith: @DavidEllis Thanks Mr. Ellis :) Got it,
Giving codes to stay awake.  http://yfrog.com/h0cicizj
@s7arbuck Hope you enjoy the map packs.
@therealcliffyb I save a special place on my person just for you.
I redub this panel Memefest '11. #PAXLite
Ready for the most amazing panel in the history of panels. #PAXLite
RT @rogXue: @DavidEllis awesome got it thanks!
Defy! Defy! Defy!  http://yfrog.com/h461jtlj
@sp8des It's tomorrow. You're good.
@scott_343 @thejessesnyder Sounds like the definition of #Winning to me.
RT @therealcliffyb: @DavidEllis I will not follow Shane, ever.
Awesome times out tonight. Good to chat w/ @therealcliffyb again. Gears 3 is looking mighty slick.
@id_Hooper So good to see you again. Rage looks awesome!
@TheMarriedGamer Fine me after the panel. You just won yourself a map code.
Epic wordsmithing by @JamesStevenson on this #PAXEast panel. How does he do it?
#PAXEast @JamesStevenson is absolutely killing it on this panel. All bow down before his wit.
OMG! Just hit the #Utilicount motherload. #PAXEast http://t.co/M9Ajyrw
On the #PAXEast show floor again. Find me if you want Defiant map codes.
Eight is great. #Utilicount #PAXEast
Make that seven. I must be in heaven. #Utilicount #PAXEast
@grgordon At the Rage panel right now. Will be floating around afterward.
That's five...make that six. #Utilicount #PAXEast
On the #PAXEast show floor. If you see me walking around in my 343 hoodie say hi. You might just get yourself a Defiant Map code.
RT @puptastrophe: Annnd, here we go! The PAX East 2011 Video. Finally. http://bit.ly/ebPsW6
RT @alisonst: .@DavidEllis make that 4 utilikilts @ PaxEast.
That's 3! #Utilikiltcount #PAXEast
RT @alisonst: Pax utilikilt count: 2.
@shannonloftis Then you realized, "It's in Boston? F that." :)
@thelightshow What hotel? It'd be freaking weird if we're in the same one.
Yes, this room will do nicely. #PAXEastUpgrade http://t.co/uZupy93
@puptastrophe Did someone say hipster waders? I think I invented those. Very useful in SF & Seattle.
Looking at maps in Seattle, water on the left. Looking at maps in Boston, water on the right. Cross country navigation made easy. #OwnIt
Back on the east coast, #NerdForceOne is on the ground!
RT @Stepto: Soon, the worst part. Turning off the electronic devices. #NerdForceOne #noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ...
@JamesStevenson Yes!
@alisonst @ninjaharlot @stepto If someone starts playing the "piano" theme imma freak out.
@JamesStevenson Should be landing in about an hour.
@JamesStevenson In the ground? Sounds like a rough flight.
@juliabetley Sounds like that person has a future in prostitution.
@ninjaharlot Also @majornelson & @alisonst know the secret in getting to the airport early. :) #EnjoyedOurRideInThisMorning
I hear @PlayXBLA is giving away GOW3 Thrashball Cole Plushies. You should probably give them a follow.
@ninjaharlot @alisonst I don't know about #adventure, but I'll settle for #landing safely.
@alisonst @ninjaharlot I just saw my first uitlikilt of #PaxEast. Thinking about keeping a running tally. #ThatsOne
@CruelLEGACEY Equally cool. Hope to see you there.
RT @HaloWaypoint: Did you enjoy the Defiant Map Pack behind the scenes video? http://t.co/cZJYAcw YouTube version - http://t.co/83VCdIz  ...
RT @alisonst: It is now! #BestNameEvar RT @Flipyap: @alisonst Good lord, what is this, Nerd Force One?<
Though typing is awkward, my belly comes in handy for propping my laptop up. MacGyver!
@Greenspeak Left it on a plane last year doofus! Why do you always bring it up? Oh the humanity!
Let's do a headcount. Reply if you're on in-flight wifi on the way to PAX East.
@majornelson Truth. I was just going to retweet with the #LikeABoss hashtag.  Your powers are legendary.
Kind of wish I had a smaller laptop right now. Guy in front of me just leaned back & I have to fold mine up to use it. #LongFlight
@majornelson Wait that'll work? @gogoinflight
I might be in the back of the plane, but at least there's wi-fi! #PaxEast
@Batgirl Sounds like someone needs another trip to the douche bar. :)
@DevinOlsen @hypertrooper @sai__kun Suddenly got a case of zzz's & I still have to pack before my flight in the am. Enjoy the maps though.
@Hypertrooper @DevinOlsen @Sai__kun I might still be on then. Have an  early flight to PAX East in the morning. GT: Total Sellout
@rukizzel Don't think anyone ever said it was hands-on, but I think it worked out ok.
@NBAKirkland Yep, but basically use your best judgement.
@NBAKirkland You can tweet about getting them, but please hang off on the other thing.
Thanks to @majornelson for having us out to show off the Defiant Map Pack. See you at PAX East.
Looking forward to the Defiant Map event at the Microsoft store in Bellevue tonight with Frank & @majornelson. Drop by & say hi.
@Batgirl Looking forward to tonight.
