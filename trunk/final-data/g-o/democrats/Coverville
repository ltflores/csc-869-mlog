@Ziggy66 I hope not. I would hope that was a style consistent with how the singer usually sings. Maybe more noticeable compared to Karen?

Ooh! Coverville's been nominated for a Podcast Award this year. If you like, please visit http://bit.ly/1fU5Pv and cast a vote for my show!
@MrGuilt And actually "Nothing Compares 2 U" is a cover of The Family. Prince did write it, though. I'd still be remiss in not including it.
@MrGuilt Makes you wonder if Prince ever did a song called "OMG I Wanna Sex U Up LOL"
Tonight's cover story will be for upcoming birthday girl Sin√©ad O'Connor. Listen while you eat your dinner in a fancy restaurant.
RT @Randydeluxe: Just had a blast with @extralife , @coverville and @missiondeep recording Film Sack. My face is hurting from the laughter.

I think they make everyone on Parenthood talk at the same time to keep it from being a two hour show.
@Moobacker I actually found out about them recently with their punk covers album! But they have a new album, don't they?
Ustream chat is dead tonight. No, not dull or boring, but actually dead. Thanks, uStream, for breaking my favorite part of the live show.

Had to go to Tristan's school to drop off his glasses. You'd think that when everything's all blurry, you'd notice long before 2nd period.
