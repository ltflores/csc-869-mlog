@samdemuro Thanks for the tip!  Duly followed! :)
@DangerousLee Happy to answer it, it's just not really a 140 character answer! :)
...and yes, make the world a totally better place with way happier and healthier everybody, but I was feeling selfish in that moment.
I have a dream this generation is going to turn sexuality so wonderfully around so well that I may someday actually be able to retire. :P

@thedaisyharris Major misinfo offenses abound in that genre there around women's genital anatomy, as you obviously know.  Bless!
@thedaisyharris I can't tell you how much I appreciate you circulating that specifically to those writing in the romance genre.

Hey docs: pls give YP using hormonal BC the ability 2 get many months worth at a time so they don't wind up w/out pills, patches or rings.
Sunday is my Monday.  So, happy Sunday-Monday, y'all.
@lindathestar Oh yay, thanks!  Was delighted to be invited into such a fantastic collection of work.
@DangerousLee About...? This is probably a better conversation 4email than twitter. Feel free to drop me a line here: http://bit.ly/dmKBJI
That said, that's not bad advice for me today, and taking one's own advice is always a fun and unusual experiment.

@sexpositiveblog But we also get a lot of users who dbl back: who come in their teens, come back for more in their 20s.
@sexpositiveblog Our age range is wide w/in young people as a group: on average it's 5-25. If I had to pick an average age I'd say 17 or 18.
@sexpositiveblog The vast majority of users are under 25.  I'd say 85% at a minimum. Alexa reflects that, too.
YES! After 2 weeks of being sans vehicle in the middle of nowhere, Blue's car rides again. And we're going to ride it right out to dinner.
really needs to find the plate to her tripod b/c when she needs to put in a headshot for things, she's feeling weird using one 4 years old.
is so glad this wk is ending: so rough, all around. Going 2 do some less trying work for a few hours, then am taking tonight & Saturday off.
@kaarib That would be pretty rad.  I mean, even just for us to have a good overview of trends.  Will email you abt this: bless!
@kaarib You want to make those charts every day?  (Add multiple !?!?!???'s here.)
Does this seem interesting, or is this boring & me just being an Aries with the usual "People don't understand me enough!" stuff?
considering figuring out way to publicly document what we've done/discussed each day @Scarleteen for daily report.
@mopheadf You know, it's been a really rough week for me, and the truth is, sometimes I am happy for even a crumb of forward movement.
@mopheadf ...which they do say, at least, that IF that is so is very disturbing.
@mopheadf I agree, they certainly are not taking the right amount of responsibility here.
@mopheadf I know, I know, and boy howdy, do I know.  But you know, sometimes I'll take what we can get.

@BruceGodfrey Excellent point. Edit to "immigrated or was abducted." Either way, though, still not native.
@LiteratePervert That scares me.
@smoricebrubaker Oh my word, you are awesome.
@divinelonging UGH.
@EccentricFlower I do same, but when people fling it on my doorstep, can't control that, alas.
Think it boils down to this: 10+ years ago I was one of those weirdos on the internet. Now everyone is one of those weirdos on the internet.
Amazing how much easier it is to have ppl be responsive when I make screening calls to services/agencies now for Scarleteens than 10 yrs ago
@markemer ...instead of just trying to look up her skirt? :P
Really?  REALLY?  (And on that note, I keep feeling like I imagined the 90s.  Did I hallucinate them? I seriously want to know.)
Do we really need 2 keep pointing out to US folks that unless you're Native American, some1 in your family, at some point, was an immigrant?

@SeattleSnowJKR Don't know who you are or why you've been tweeting this stuff @ me, but asked nicely, now just blocking.
@SeattleSnowJKR Calling undocumented people "illegals" is not the truth f anything but bigotry.  Blaming rape victims, same deal.

@RobinsToyNest Yeah, don't think that's usually it with this, since it often is basically sexual bragging.
@musingvirtual And that.  Very.  save that usually, I just click a little button and make those comments or posts go buh-bye, so.
@RobinsToyNest ...and maybe also older men looking for sexual validation in a VERY weird, disruptive and inappropriate way.
@RobinsToyNest It doesn't feel predatory to me/users so much as patronizing and....well, creepy AND useless.
@Earlytobed Fo sho.
@wmccrae Doubt it, actually (+ we don't have pre-pubescent users usually). Think it's something else. Not sure what. Just know it's yuck.
Boundaries, dudes.  BOUNDARIES.
Older men who come to Scarleteen & feel they benefit our teen users by talking, unsolicited, abt what their wives enjoy w/sex freak me out.
@gimpgirl It's not, and so few of us have, especially with indy projects and those truly led/managed by women. Glad we're both still around!
