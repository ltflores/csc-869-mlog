@phae @benward breathe - you'll be awesome!
How to get to the Hacking Space talk today @ 5pm: walk down 5th to Hilton GARDEN Inn, enter via Valet Parking, go to Mezz level, room Sabine
@defunkt yay!
@schierholz @lesliebradshaw google should create a clever solution to this
The Hilton GARDEN Inn is a super weird place to put talks for SXSW in - so I'll be posting a map later on how to see my talk tomorrow!
@avantgame being introverted at a party - sent you a txt msg :)
@avantgame me too! let's be introverted together!
@joshuatopolsky @reckless good luck on your new endeavors and say hi whenever you're in SF! you both have been great!
@whatevers I'll be presenting Monday! :)
Pretty cool satellite data visualization tool: Eyes On The Earth 3D. #realspace
2 days and counting until my talk on Hacking Space Exploration! Mon @ 5pm in the Hilton GARDEN Inn. #spacehack
Mistakenly told friends to see #battledecks - which is possibly more uncomfortable than these bad presenters.
O gawd, so many great slides are being wasted on bad presenters at #battledecks so far.
With @skytland and @gerty at the #nasatweetup panel. Yay, space!
Headed to AUS with @mattb!
Installed AT&T MicroCell. Now my BlackBerry works like it should... and my iPod and speakers are unable to connect to the wifi at all. Fun.
Unboxing a free microcell from AT&T. Not sure what put me on their list for the gift, but I could definitely use a better signal.
@Voyager2 is there a dedicated page that talks about how we maintain communication/control of Voyager1 at ~11 billion miles away?
@BlackDan i found it through http://astropython.org - but the site is giving me 500 errors now :/
"Hubble Space Telescope and all that" http://flic.kr/p/9oPy2m (Watching a talk on using Python in space from a person from @STSci)
Really appreciate the thoughtfulness put into clear communication of info on @spacelogdotorg. Example of why @NASA needs to hire outsiders.
@jaylett oh, yes, i do. commencing do-over.
@nuzz i hope you find her. i first saw @mattb on a muni - it was with incredible serendipity that we were going to the same place :)
Great article on "The Power of Lonely: what we do better without other people around": http://is.gd/HK61r5 (thx @nuzz)
Watching How The Universe Works on @sciencechannel while sitting down to spend some quality time on @spacehack-related awesomeness.
RT @spacehack: Spacehack will be @SXSW - come check out "Hacking Space Exploration: Robots, the Universe & Everything" on Monday at 5pm  ...
@timoni @leyink I, in fact, had started a Twitter list dedicated to tweeting space robots http://is.gd/04HPm9 (no humans tweeting as robots)
@AndrewCrow my reason is because I need a dedicated device for the activity. I am too distracted on my laptop to focus on one thing.
Why is it that when I heard there might be a re-make of TRON, I was excited -but when I heard about a re-make of Blade Runner, I'm worried ?
@eddie he took it 1 year before I joined. jerk.
Weird/morbid late night list to read: list of inventors killed by their own inventions: http://is.gd/yoWt7h
@tomcoates @avantgame @verbiee @mattb The Adjustment Bureau meets Hot Tub Time Machine?
@tomcoates @avantgame @verbiee well @mattb & I are fighting the plan -those fedora-wearing Nokians can't keep us apart! Atlantic Ocean, psha
@tomcoates @avantgame @verbiee well, 99.9% didn't remain "trapped" because they didn't have the resources to give a shit about everyone.
Today is my 4 year anniversary w/ Twitter. I remember I joined a week before I went to SXSW for the first time, which led to me moving to SF
We have been adjusted. They killed the audio to the movie. We're onto you @tomcoates - do you own a fedora?
Just replied to an email from June 2010. Now if I could get my Firefox tabs closed off, I'd have a proper accomplishment exuberance.
@phae have him feed you mexicokes. pretty sure there's some in the fridge still.
@puzzlehead I'll be presenting Hacking Space Exploration: Robots, the Universe and Everything: http://is.gd/MTWOJD
@vmltweets FYI, your SEER video on http://vml.com/seer doesn't work (I tried on Safari and Firefox), just loads the window but no video.
My SXSW tip: edit your friends list on Twitter + Foursquare now so that you're not overwhelmed w/ tons of updates from too many people.
Learning about epigenetics.
@caseorganic the device would probably burst into flames if I wore it! ;)
@atavistian aw, thanks for tuning in! :)
@michiokaku I'd love to win a copy of #2100physics - have been talking about the future of citizen science all this week at @iftf + @twit!

Really awesome day talking to all the awesome people at @iftf. Got a ride home from @pescovitz who everyone should convince to use Twitter.
We are living in the Microsoft Paint era of 3D printing.
@p_ridolfi in the States, people aren't familiar with the detergent brand (it's also typically a female name here)
On a train headed to the Institute For The Future (@iftf)!
@gretared speaking as a very impatient person, I think impatience is a virtue.
@Rchards @leisa added a comment to the post since i organized @sciencehackday sf recently.
@nuzz they are when you run out of character space! that's my if-else rule.
@monkeystick thx for the heads up!
Here's the video of me forecasting the future from earlier today on @TWiT's Fourcast show: http://youtu.be/9HtExITtQeY
@dburka I just had to choose Team Robot, sorry!
Had a lot of fun forecasting the future on @twit's Fourcast show! Will post the link to audio/video when it's up for those that missed it.
@GordMcLeod thanks! it's fun to forecast the future!
@extralife thanks for having me on, Scott! It was a lot of fun :) if you're going to SXSW we can chat about space stuff in person!
I'll be on the Fourcast podcast on http://live.twit.tv in 15 min. or so!
@lanyrdsxsw are you going to add the ability to say what room/venue a specific session is located in? would help.
Did each and every kid really need to have a massive logo plastered across their chest? Let them dress up for frack sake. #Oscars
Was trying to act like I didn't care about the #Oscars, but Hans Zimmer was seriously robbed, by far he had the best original score!
I'll be forecasting the future on the FourCast podcast live tomorrow at 4pm PT: http://twit.tv/fourcast (got any tips, @badastronomer?)
@moleitau @snve @jorngeorg @timo would love to see how it looks if connected to appoximate AT&T signal strength in San Francisco
@bethbeck i remember when i had to track that kind of info in an Excel sheet at NASA, but it was long before most of those accounts existed!
My last day of ~9-to-5 work for a while was on Friday, which means... I'm back to staying up 'til 4am most nights! That didn't take long.
@benward your next hashtag binge should be #hipsterscience a la @mza
Science brainstorming overload. Hard 2 stay focused when there's a multitude of awesome projects that need my attention. Good problem 2 have
@violetblue if @slate were more fully in charge of how their articles transpired, we'd be seeing, on average, more readership, fewer idiots.
@violetblue the 'sex is cheap' @slate article is idiotic instead of controversial. slate should hire people who give a damn about research.
@waferbaby @timoni *Alternative* Reality Game

@simonw @benward did you see the LEGO version of Settlers of Catan? http://www.brothers-brick.com/2011/02/24/lego-catan/
@PrinKmusic it's real! thankfully they made Robonaut 2 (@astrorobonaut) which looks less creepy: http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp
Every time I see Robonaut 1, it reminds me of a hermit crab that crawled out of its shell (gross): http://is.gd/yqsD54
@BasilLeaf hmm, curious to see a more detailed argument as to how this is projection of self versus already well-studied mirror-neurons.
San Francisco Snow-pico-lypse: http://flic.kr/p/9m7aXd (screenshot of how big a deal it is to the local news here)
Have SO MUCH of my sched booked up for March and April. Thankfully it's all awesomely exciting stuff about space exploration and the future!
@jonverve looks like I might indeed! will you be there?
@KariByron excited that you're on twitter finally! :)
Dim sum with @violetblue is always delightful :)
"Urban Robots Could Use Manholes to Navigate" http://bit.ly/eL6RK7 can't even come up w/ a clever tweet encapsulating my WTF? 2that headline
@spacexer you should start using permalinks on http://www.spacex.com/updates.php so that people can easily link to them.
@wolvie75 NASA astronauts will be using Russia's Soyuz spacecraft temporarily and then most likely will be using SpaceX (which is exciting)
@Huxley yep - i'm speaking at it: http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP000404

In case you missed the NASA shuttle launch just now, they have replays looping on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-hd-tv
@BadAstronomer yeah, did a column about the intersection of sex & technology for a bit. it was fun and they have a great community.
@jonverve he's my cousin-in-law (so you can say I sent you) :) nice guy. i think also he worked on World Wind for a while.
@BadAstronomer i somewhat felt similar when i used to write for SuicideGirls :)
@jonverve btw, do you know Brad Fisher at Goddard?
@jonverve My NASA Data and Night Sky Network are already on @spacehack! currently, @spacehack is a directory of specific project sites.
Gorgeous photo of Paris from space: http://flic.kr/p/9knMwR (thx @astro_paolo + @esa)
@waferbaby did sparks fly? #giggity
RT @NathanaelB: RT Blog post: My account of yesterday's massive and horrific quake in Christchurch http://bit.ly/fpfiJD #eqnz
@bookhling you should connect with @markpernice (a fellow space enthusiast in NYC interested in launching weather balloon payloads). chat!
@TammyCamp thx! feel free to email me whenever at ariel@arielwaldman.com
