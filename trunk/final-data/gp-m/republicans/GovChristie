@brian4NY @Jencohn201 So wrong. Corzine & Dems could have extended it for a yr or made it permanent before I arrived & I couldn't change it.
@KevinEhret4NJ @julescator Wrong again. Tax surcharge expired on 12/31/09. Corzine was Gov & Dems in charge of Leg. 19 days till I took over
Question of the day: Do the Senate President and Assembly Speaker support gas tax increases or not?  NJers deserve an answer!
And Senate President Sweeney has been silent on the issue altogether.
Ystrdy, I called out the Legislative Dems on their plan to increase gas taxes & now Spkr Oliver refuses to state her position on the bills.
@julescator Gov Corzine gave that tax cut, not this Administration. Get your facts straight please.
@NJTxPyrCommuter That's what I am doing. No inc taxes 4 anyone in NJ--already pay highest taxes in USA.
@NJTxPyrCommuter Already did mos. ago. $1.6B per yr for 5 yrs. Tripled pay-go, reduced % of debt & used PA tunnel $. No cut in any funding.
@NJTxPyrCommuter 24 cents per gallon
See what I had to say about Dems wanting to raise the gas tax at my town hall in Evesham today - http://bit.ly/lH6OS1
No matter how you slice it, Legislative Democrats want to raises taxes by billions of dollars on overburdened NJ families
Not 1, but 2 pending plans in the legislature would increase the gas tax by as much as $2.4B over the next 3 years
Gas prices have surged to $3.88 cents per gallon, $1.09 higher than a year ago, yet Legislative Democrats want to increase prices even more
