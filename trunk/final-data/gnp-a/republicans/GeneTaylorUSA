"Budget debates are not just about programs of govt; they're also about the purpose of govt."~Paul Ryan  #Teaparty #tcot #tlot #gop #patriot
@gemimms  The CONSISTENT values within the #TeaParty are FISCAL DISCIPLINE & LIMITED GOVERNMENT. We disagree on the social issues.
@gemimms  That would be fine, IF the TeaParty was a single cohesive entity. But it's an amalgam of different groups with different values.
@ChesterDeGrasse   Actually, the #TeaParty believes America is a STRONG COUNTRY with very WEAK LEADERSHIP & no fiscal discipline.  Nice try.
@bbetsill  Politics is a contact sport, but it was like McCain didn't want to get his hands dirty.  Anybody else could have beaten Obama.
@Lilobri  Which is great. But why do they need Federal funding. They raise money like every other charity.
@CO2HOG  Right. Some of them are still here. We need to get rid of all those selfish people and their stupid jobs.
@bbetsill  He ran like he didn't really want the job. I doubt that he would have been all that good, but lot better than Obama.
@bbetsill  Bush set us up for Obama, and McCain sealed the deal. Created a "perfect storm" that Obamanation rode into DC.
@bbetsill  GWB ran as a conservative & governed as a liberal. His dad was useless, but was Reagan's 2nd in command, Both were lousy.
@bbetsill  I can totally understand that.  But I haven't seen many Libertarian candidates I had much respect for . . . UNTIL RECENTLY.
@bbetsill  I wish I could be a libertarian. I believe in the principles. I just don't see how they could ever control Congress.
@LiberalJohn34  But you'd trust Democrats who have FAILED three generations of children?  Pathetic.
@bbetsill "If you're 20 and a conservative, you have no heart. If you're 40 and a liberal, you have no brain."- Winston Churchill
@rixshep  Don't you love how Soros wants the U.S. to bankrupt itself - like Greece & most of the EU?
I vote Democrat because govt can do a better job spending the money I earn than I can. #teaparty #tcot #tlot #ucot #gop #patriot #ampat
There must be a SHIFT CHANGE or LUNCH break at Media Matters. My Liberal antagonists have gone quiet. #teaparty #tcot #tlot #ucot #gop #ocra
I vote Democrat because 4% oil companies' profits are obscene, but the govt taxing gas at 15% isn't. #teaparty #tcot #tlot #ucot #gop #ocra
@rixshep  Obama has never owned anything in his life: a house, a car, a job, a recession, a war. NOTHING.  #Teaparty #tcot #tlot #gop #ucot
The problem with Liberals is they can't distinguish between dreams & reality. Wishing only makes it so in Disney movies. #teaparty #tcot
I hope all you Liberals remember to thank the Obamanation every time you pay $4.00 a gallon for gasoline & $4.30 for diesel. #Teaparty #tcot
@slicedsky  Nope. And, now it's one of Obama's GOALS.
@bbetsill  I guess you're right. Never dawned on me those clown would be proud unemployment cut tax revenues as spending increased. RETARDS
Liberals are BRAGGING that tax revenues are lowest since 1950s - ignoring the high unemployment that caused them. #Teaparty #tcot #tlot #gop
@AmericasBrave @pookyscott @jamestuo I can only imagine how proud you'd be if employment & tax collections dropped some more.
@jamestuo @pookyscott @AmericasBrave You're PROUD because employment is down & drove down tax REVENUES?  That's pathetic. My post said RATES
@AmericasBrave  @SarahPalinUSA  Lowest employment rate since the 1930s. Lowest tax rates, if you don't count the '80s.
@LeftsideAnnie  HAHAHAHAHAHA  You're much funnier when you're off your meds. Have a great day.
@LeftsideAnnie  Annie, are you off your medication again? Better go back on it or they'll put you back in the rubber room.
Obama is protected by 11,500 soldiers & 4,000 police officers. No one is assigned to protect my family.  #Teaparty #tcot #tlot #patriot #nra
Gun owners are compensating for something - like being smaller & weaker than most criminals.  #Teaparty #tcot #tlot #ucot #patriot #gop #nra
@Mereswin  Do have any skills at all. You try to insult people, but you're not articulate enough to pull it off. Go play in the traffic.
@LeftsideAnnie  we may "own" him, but it doesn't mean he did what he was hired to do. Kinda like Obama for you libs.  ROFL
@Marnus3  Bush ran as a conservative, but governed as a liberal. But look who the other choice was in 04. Yucch!
@Mereswin  And you're a genius. Illiterate, but a genius nonetheless. ROFLMAO
@JoeHaisley  ROFLMAO
@River_City  YUP.  Pathetic, huh?
@justgrateful @Marnus3  So, Obama DOUBLED in two years what it took Reagan eight years to accomplish. That's something to be proud of.  ROFL
@JoeHaisley  NOPE. In DC, it's far more important to LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING than in actually doing something.
@River_City  Also remember: All news stories are true - except those of which you have FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE.
@River_City  WE're probably more together than we think, because the media wants us to think we're disorganized. Fear is a tactic.
America ran up $57 billion in ADDITIONAL DEBT while Congress & Obama were negotiating $38 billion in cuts.
@GaltsGirl @Randletr  NOPE! We've got Allen West, Michelle Bachman, Paul Ryan, Herman Cain and a host of REAL conservatives. Have patience!
@River_City  That's OK though. The Independents, who were fooled by the Obamination in 2008, aren't fooled any more!
@Mereswin  Only in Liberal circles is communication NOT the responsibility of the communicator.  You folks crack me up!
@River_City @LJZumpano  He who controls the media controls the message.  Dems control the media.
"We have room for but one language in this country and that is the English language."-T.Roosevelt #TeaParty #tcot #tlot #gop #patriot #ocra
@justgrateful  I'm sure it's my fault. After all, I am a conservative.  We're always wrong.  RORL
@Mereswin  What you said wasn't even a complete sentence, grammatically correct and made no sense. But it that doesn't bother you . . .
@justgrateful  So, you really don't just care about American jobs, you want American jobs with American owned businesses?  Pretty picky, eh?
