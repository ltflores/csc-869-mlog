If you still wish to bury your head in the sands (pun intended), don't follow this link: http://bit.ly/gdN2C4 #yegfed
Is this one a) Linda Duncan b) Hugo Chavez c) Trotsky or d) A 1972 Government of Alberta document ? #yegfed
"Alberta should regulate and control the Athabasca tar sands development for the socio-economic development of Albertans." #yegfed
If you refuse to believe d) Business Week, congratulations, you can now volunteer on Ryan Hastman's campaign. #yegfed
Is it a) socialists b) separatists c) Greenpeace or d) Business Week ? #yegfed
Guess the source: "the government has not said whether the proposal will include tar send reserves". #yegfed
Clear evidence of the un-Albertan and job destroying use of the term tar sands: http://bit.ly/ecsmXW #yegfed

@robin_ec @denny1h Can't say I have. I did read "Denying AIDS" by Seth Kalichman.
@denny1h @robin_ec and here's two years ago: http://bit.ly/hGyj1I
@denny1h @robin_ec Here's one from only 4 years ago: http://bit.ly/ihIfIM I feel dirty about buying that album with All My Life on it.
@foofighters you guys still believe crazy stuff about AIDS?
@avnishnanda @jaimanchin @naidoo @andrew_leach can we call it the anti-coalition freedom-sands?
@denny1h @robin_ec Plus, you need big time penance to undo the damage they've potentially done. Like millions of dollars to an aids charity.
@denny1h @robin_ec I saw the group listed on their site as recent as two years ago.
@denny1h I want video just so I can see him stammer "The coalition will be..." looks down "reckless!"

@IPEdmonton Really? You need a script to endlessly repeat misleading talking points?
Breaking: Hastman set to swim in tailings pond in effort to tout the job creating goodness of getting sick from tailings ponds. #yegfed
Laugh of the day: Ryan Hastman accusing someone else of using emotional rhetoric. #yegfed #omgscarycoalition #they'recomingtotakeourjobs!
RT @joelhousman: Remember when Planned Parenthood & NPR crashed the market, wiped out half our 401Ks and took TARP money? Me neither.
@jamesrajotte talking about phasing out subsidies in oil sands! He's coming to take our jobs and attack Alberta! Socialism! #yegfed
So no labour policy in #ndp platform either. Guess that makes Harper and Hastman that much dumber for labelling them socialists. #yegfed

Reading #cpc, #lpc platforms. No labour policy in either. MPs vote on labour issues, why not include in platform? #yegfed
@Brucesfarside at rate libs are going they wont form gov either. Maybe we're seeing the decline of the Canada lib party like euro countries?
@Brucesfarside no mention of labour policy there, even greens have a labour platform.
@Brucesfarside then the libs backtracked on anti-scab, and voted against pay equity. How does the platform fare?
@markiemoose looks like dumb kids, not party specific. #yegfed
@Brucesfarside any highlights? Lowlights?
@Brucesfarside how's the lib platform on labour? Haven't read it yet. Their voting record ain't so hot.
