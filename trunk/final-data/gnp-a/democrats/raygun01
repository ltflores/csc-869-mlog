Another Astronomically Awesome All About Android! OK, maybe that's overdoing it but @kevinpurdy was a great guest. Publishes tomorrow!
RT @psyburat: "[Getting Things Done] is a very efficient cult." -@raygun01 (ha! I'm happy someone caught that!)
All About Android goes live in about an hour at live.twit.tv! @eileentv @ronxo myself and today's guest, @kevinpurdy! See you then.
@amandafrench ha! Nice shout out! Maybe someone will actually get that ball rolling now.
Brand spanking new grill means flank steak tonight. win
@extralife @eileentv amen!!!
I was interviewed for this site, along with many other names you'll recognize throughout the coming weeks! http://t.co/dcK6zJQ
@eileentv I'm happy that's not my hotel room.
@kevinchen Understood. Believe me, $2 is by no means the end of the world. I just have little daily use for HDR. Hence, not worth it 2 me.
@kevinchen me too what?  You used that app? What did you think?
RT @PhoneBoy: @raygun01 what camera app do u recommend for Android? (I like Vignette a lot but it's slow on moto droid. Otherwise,  great!)
I should clarify that Pro HDR isn't a BAD app..  just not worth $2 for such a single purpose app.
Doh. Forgot that the refund policy for Android Market is now 15 minutes and not 24 hrs. I now own Pro HDR.
@brandonlpierce I believe @shwood uses VidBlaster but it costs $$.  Not sure of a free alternative. Or try screen cap s/w like iseeu.
Can App Inventor be used for tablets? #xoom
@LarryOrtiz you have a bit too much faith in my abilities to program for Android. :)
Here's a reason for me to use the Xoom every day once the application exists: tablet optimized programmable sound board.  :) does it exist?
@sarahlane hmmmm.  Hearty and vodka don't seem like they go together. I'm sorry my homeland let you down.
@sarahlane Nice! Tell me you tried it?
@drkiki so awesome seeing you and the little guy too!  He's adorable,  of course!
Nice! A Kickstarter project that I pitched in for finally came to completion! :) http://bit.ly/govCZI $$ well spent.
Just saw @drkiki and son. He is tiny. He is where Lucy was 1 year ago, yet it seems SO long ago. I miss that tiny ball of warmth.
@cabbieBot So far, the need appears to be when I'm on my phone and need to write a longer email, it's easier to use the Xoom for that.
#Xoom is a tad heavy but the good ol' rest it on your legs technique works fine. I'm enjoying Honeycomb, though occasional UI hangups.
Gmail for Honeycomb screams for chat integration. #xoom
Testing out the Twitter app on the Motorola Xoom. Kind of boring looking to be honest.
@NotMyRealName Funny, we had that conversation when @eileentv gave me the tablet. I'd heard it was on the back before I got it. :)
@eileentv My initial reaction is "Woo-Hoo! Free XOOM tablet! (for a few days)" I'm curious to see how I find ways to "need" to use it. :)
@JonStrickland That's a smart play right there.
Going to NAB? Check out @NewTekInc 's Broadcast Minds session with @leolaporte and others.
@PhatEmoKid Shut up you.... guy.
@benpike Unfortunately... yes.
Claritan-D: Works. Claritan minus the D: Doesn't Work. Claritan + Sudafed (as the D replacement) works but WHOA... I'm floating in space.
The Commodore 64 is back! http://m.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/the-commodore-64-is-back/12192 (want!)
I don't use GetGlue myself... but if YOU do, here you go! http://bit.ly/eG0Nn7 #aaa
@jeffthefate I won't say that its the snappiest thing  in the world, but its serviceable until I can upgrade my hardware.
@jeffthefate CyanogenMod 7 Nightly 4/3/11
@JoshHilp You don't HAVE to.... but if you do, post it on YouTube and send us a link. :)
@Veronica @extralife un-read! un-read!
All About Android #2 (MP3) now published! Refresh your feeds or go here: http://bit.ly/hlDDiw Video encoding, soon to be published!
My dad will never learn not to pass along forwarded WMV files via email. I must come to terms with this. It's in his DNA.
@gkneeisme @eileentv on second thought it's a mixture of being hungry and having Rainbow Connection stuck in my head on repeat.
@dogg Had to know the Xoom would not work right when it counts. :/ Thanks!
@Catatonic That would work if we saw a green person... but all we saw was green. Nothing else. So then, all we'd see is grey.
Just finalizing today's All About Android with @eileentv and @ronxo! Catch it live tonight in 40 min at live.twit.tv (5pm PT every Monday)
RT @AdobeAE: That site and many more good source of After Effects tutorials and information are listed here: http://bit.ly/c06llu (WOOT!)
OK cough. Remnant of a flu that is now three weeks past. Exit my lungs. PLEEEEASE. So incredibly annoying.
RT @metal0130: the videocopilot is a .net domain, the .com leads to a ad-squatter. Good luck with whatever you are working on! (oops! thx)
Whatdaya know, here's another After Effects site loaded with tutorials: http://bit.ly/sC8s7
