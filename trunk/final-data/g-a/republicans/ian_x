Everyone else getting the Facebook FailWall?
I wish there was a browser plug-in that hid all content made up of a single paragraph over 200 words. I'd forget about most internet idiots.

Dragging feeling this afternoon arrested by potent and delicious iced coffee from @VoltageCoffee!
Be sure to use homonyms correctly. Example: "In lieu of the loo, you should never use Lou."
.@iFanboy You definitely nailed a lot of those. (I have the exact experience with seeing great colors and Matt Wilson's name coming up.)
RT @iFanboy: Here's the Eisner nominations they missed. Hard. http://bit.ly/dZvgBr
A weakness: I can't say the same thing twice in a row in exactly the same way. Leads to some weird phrasing.
@MikeSHenderson What's the difference? Positive economic outlook is the dominant factor in creating a strong economy.

@NateCosBOOM Cool Ranch.
The GOP and Tea Party claim they are holding out for budgetary reasons, but they are endangering our economy on a purely social issue.
I support #plannedparenthood. To hold the budget and economy hostage to a federal shutdown, to defund them? Unconscionable and dishonest.
@BrianLynch I hear HOP is terrible. ;) Maybe the one with the psycho teenager?
RT @CobraCommander: Remember dear federal workers of the United States, when your country abandons you, Cobra will not. Join me!
RT @RaeBeta: Because misinformation kills. #IStandWithPlannedParenthood
So far, today does seem better thanks to more sleep. The real test will be how I feel after this delicious lunch, though. heh

Starting a 3-week "sleep diet" (in bed by 9:30 weeknights, 9 hours of sleep otherwise). In bed so long my lower back hurts. Still tired. #fb

RT @kwanzer: Happy for all the Eisner nominees. Can we bring back the Best Editor category? Yes, I am shamelessly plugging. What? WHAT?
However, I can confirm that Trader Joe's milk chocolate covered toffee popcorn is still delicious after half a bag.
Eating a lot of sugar when feeling tired and run down does not, despite the instinct, result in having more energy. Quite the opposite. #fb
@matthewdowsmith The guys at @graphicly are great to work with, even when you're a little fish like me. :)
Did you know three of my comics are on Graphic.ly? S'truth, it is. Search for "Black Label Comics" an' see.
@onegemini @matthewdowsmith Oh. I thought he was talking about Diddling.
@matthewdowsmith Wait, you mean you aren't drawing Doctor Ummm and Ummmblade? I'm so confused now.

Seriously, unless it's over 9 1/2 hours, how much I sleep has no bearing on my energy levels.
@andydiggle I don't recognize this phrase: "first thing on Sunday morning". Is it British slang I missed?
Wow. Thought it was just from missing coffee, but even after breakfast and coffee I'm really wiped out. Ugh.
