Appearing in "The Good Wife" tomorrow night. Sneak-peek video clip at my new web site "Fred Thompson's America": http://bit.ly/e3R2HW #tcot
Obama to propose "significant debt reduction". Should be easy. Just do everything he did in his first 2 years again, except backwards. #tcot
WH describes Trump's remarks about Obama as "sideshow behavior". So... are they saying the Obama administration is a 3-ring circus? #tcot
Pelosi:GOP should "take back their party so it doesn't matter who wins". I'd rather win so it doesn't matter if we take back our party #tcot
Navy burns small boat in at-sea test of new laser weapon. Needs more testing. Also, I've heard Somali pirates have lots of small boats #tcot
Obama reply to gas-price grumbler: "you might want to think about a trade-in". Ladies & gentlemen, I give you the new GOP 2012 slogan. #tcot
Here's a nice little write-up on the, uh, "cordial chat" I had with Dee Dee Myers about Obamacare on Thursday: http://bit.ly/e2YGIo #tcot

Thanks, Gerri Willis, for having me on to discuss leadership - and for accidentally introducing me as "President" http://bit.ly/fz6HTi #tcot
I'm going to be on the Fox Business Network during the 5:00 hour (Eastern Time) discussing the looming govt shutdown. Set your DVR! #tcot

Study using samples of traffic pollution in southern CA shows it may cause brain damage. That explains Hollywood. What's up with DC? #tcot
HHS turns 6 pages of Obamacare law into 429 of regs. Haven't seen return on investment like that since Hillary played w/cattle futures #tcot
Obama official: govt shutdown may cancel Natl Cherry Blossom Parade. Yeah, who'd want a balanced budget when you can have a parade? #tcot
Study: Congress members spend 27% of their time taunting one another. That's why I left the Senate. I wanted to do it full time. #tcot
Shutdown looms, Dem Rep Brown invites fellow lawmakers on shopping trip. Dems now so desperate, they're spending they're own money. #tcot
Pelosi to speak at Soros-funded "change the world" conference. Good choice. She certainly managed to change who controls Congress. #tcot
Obama: "I remember what it was like to pump gas." Uh huh. And we remember what it was like to be able to afford it. #tcot
IRS "wealth squad" steps up high-earner audits. They play rough, too. If you don't pay your taxes, they make you an Obama appointee. #tcot
Obama holding budget summit w/ Congressional leaders. Waste of GOP's time. Just Tweet @whitehouse "Dude. We're broke. Stop spending." #tcot
State Dept "deeply concerned" on China dissident crackdown. President Hu must've misunderstood when we said "do more" on human rights. #tcot

One of the Runaway Democrats from Indiana said that what he did was like serving in Afghanistan. Which side? #tcot
Hatch on Obama as a leader: he "just doesn't know what to do". Actually, the real problem is that we just don't want him to do it. #tcot
Fmr DNC Chair Dean: Fox is "well-funded, right-wing propaganda organization". Well, he's pretty far left. Thinks same thing about NPR. #tcot
Chicago residents spot UFO. Last seen being chased by local community organizers, hoping to get the aliens registered as Democrats. #tcot
Obama announced for 2012 via electronic social media. If he wanted to show how trendy he is, should've announce it at Tea Party rally #tcot
