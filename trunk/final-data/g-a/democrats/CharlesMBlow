@ToureX I'm sorry, but some things are sacred.
Sade + Jay-Z = blasphemous mistake.
If your tweet-to-follower ratio is more than 10-to-1, maybe that should tell you something and maybe you should listen. Just a thought...
Morning Joe...done!
Up at this ungodly hour getting ready for Morning Joe.
Off to the gym.  Me and this body have a some things we need to work through.
There is only so much energy in a life - you can spending it blaming oppressors or claiming successes.
There's a line frm Miss Ever's Boys (I think) paraphrasing: 4 blacks life is a hill-you can climb it or stay at the bottom. (Applies to all)
@ChelseaStarrLA I was agreeing and identifying.
@LaurenLaCapra Not a one until I was about 4
@ChelseaStarrLA My mother would have cut off her right arm before she accepted welfare, and we were POOR
There was no expectation that anyone outside the community was going to help, so they set about helping themselves.
If a child misbehaved, "the community" corrected him. It was multi-generational, multi-familial child rearing.
When I was little, there wasn't a single single-parent on the block.  Everybody worked.  Everybody went to church.  Everybody voted.
I went to a small, rural school in La., but excellence was in the air. Performance/behavior (more cultured we thought) were points of pride
If you are going to blame "The Man" for his part, you must also blame"The Man In The Mirror" for his.  And that concludes today's sermon.
...we must take responsibility for not being more engaged in the pol process. (Only 30% of blks know Repubs control House. Sad.)
....we must allowing the cultural nonsense!  Every song can't be about strippers.  I mean, come on (I don't let my daughter watch videos)
...we must stress the benefits of marriage MUCH more.  Families offer so many - support, taxes, health.  It's incredible.
...we must remove the stigmas about discussing sex and contraception so blk girls (who r less sexually active) don't have highest preg rates
...we must inculcate a culture of excellence, obstacles not withstanding, where parent pressure in even greater than peer pressure
...if we dealt with our own issues,"the problem" would be half way solved.  For instance....
...Yes, we should advocate for systematic change, but we must champion/demand/insist upon changing ourselves...
And let me just preach for a second...There are two sides to "The Black Problem": systematic injustice and personal/cultural responsibility
Tried to watch "The Black Agenda" special on MSNBC. Couldn't.  Had to turn it off.

@Rima_Regas "I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president," - Obama, January 2010.
From that old Negro spiritual ... by Tupac: "And although it seems heaven sent/We ain't ready, to see a black President..."
Scheduled to be on MSNBCs "Morning Joe" tomorrow from 6-7 a.m. EST.  Tune in if you can.
"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away."
@LilEsBella Maybe in the building, not sure, but definitely not at home.
On today's column: Not sure Obama can placate his detractors. They have come to view him the man as flawed, policies notwithstanding.
Pondering: Is the coffee at the shop down the block *really* that much better than my own, or is it all in my head?

@tuleesha Avg black kid and Obama should probably be in different sentences.
@schwanderer The reaction to Obama is not Obama's fault.  That was just a scab on our society that got prick when he got picked.
