@cathysherwin It won't effect them. But no 1 should have 2 worry. M'care would b fine if so many OTHER pgms were cut http://huff.to/eRfZGI
@cheeriogrrrl Seems like it didn't matter to the AZ legislators what the public wanted. All polls showed public strongly AGAINST this.
@tonyspeak We need to be honest & not ignore Dems who r corporate tools. Lesser of two evils is still evil.

@tonyspeak That article contains sensible ways to reduce deficit. None of which Ryan has in his Path To Poverty. Congress needs 2 WAKE UP.
Mike Lux lays out sensible, progressive ways that deficit can be cut w/o attacking middle class & poor. http://huff.to/eRfZGI

@tonyspeak Or here http://bit.ly/haKkjf. None of this is needed if oil & farm subsidies, which are corporate giveaways, were cut.
@tonyspeak It's going to be more than that. Read the 2nd to last paragraph here http://bit.ly/ehc0Hx
@Charmed86  It has been widely reported that Obama will make cuts 2  Medicare & Medicaid. None r needed if oil & farm subsidies were cut
@tonyspeak "Obama...plan to reduce deficit,...by scaling back govt's chief health programs for seniors & the poor." http://huff.to/hb1ZOg
@ib2smrt4u It won't pass because both Dems & GOP leadership are owned by corporate financial elite. Look at Obama's financial advisers.
@HowieChicago Don't limit your "fuck yous" to the GOP. Where are the DEMS, except Progressive Caucus, plans to reduce military spending NOW?

@jprogress1 Sorry but we won't be fine if Ryan's Path To Poverty budget proposal is allowed to pass. And Obama's plan isn't much better.
The only real Democratic budget - The Hill's Congress Blog http://bit.ly/hCCkIM ||Call Congress, tell them to support the People's Budget
Ryan's Path To Poverty will reward further those responsible for r economic hardship while adding to the suffering of millions of Americans
@dansden Not sure what you mean.  The link is functioning correctly.
The 2012 budget proposals by GOP and Obama both ignore 62% of Americans by LOWERING taxes on the rich http://bit.ly/ijnU7O
Congress is IGNORING THE NATION. 62% of Americans say raising taxes on rich is the 1st step to balancing the budget. http://bit.ly/ijnU7O
46% of those earning MORE THAN $100K/yr say RAISING TAXES ON THE RICH should be the 1ST STEP TO BALANCING THE BUDGET http://bit.ly/ijnU7O
The Progressive Caucus's People's Budget will eliminate the deficit in same time frame as Ryan's Path To Poverty. http://1.usa.gov/fs1XAp
Ryan's Path To Poverty budget will be the final piece in the Corporate takeover. This is the budget WE need passed http://1.usa.gov/fs1XAp
@kflanagan Ryan's Path To Poverty will be the final piece for the corporate takeover of our country. 25% top tax rate, kill M'care & M'caid
Corporate media is pumping up Ryan's Path To Poverty praising him for 'having a plan' & ignoring People's Budget http://1.usa.gov/fs1XAp
@onevoice2 We need to let Congress know that we know it exists. Corporate media is already praising Ryan saying at least he has a plan
@onevoice2 @timmytink Not surprising that the top google searches for people's budget doesnt bring up any corporate media (msm) source.

Educate yourself.  Let Congress know that u know they r working 4 1% of the population. America will be ruined if "Path To Poverty" passes
Are you paying attention?  The GOP "Path To Poverty" will decimate America's middle class & poor while FURTHER enriching the financial elite
