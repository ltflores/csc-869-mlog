I'll give an update on the MS River flood situation around 1 p.m. CST. Watch it on our Webcast: http://bit.ly/65d0Cg
Requested a disaster declaration for 11 counties along the MS River. We're about to see a flood at historic levels.
Smithville now has a disaster recovery center. Stop by & sign up for FEMA aid. To donate $10 to help our tornado victims, text MS to 27722
