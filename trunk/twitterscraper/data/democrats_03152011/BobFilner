When construction is complete we will have a more effective and efficient border. SY is, after all, the busiest port-of-entry in the world!

Today I once again voted against the Patriot Act. We shouldn't be giving the gov't free reign to trample on our civil liberties. #PatriotAct

Locally, these drastic cuts will jeopardize construction and modernization of the Calexico, Otay Mesa, and San Ysidro land ports-of-entry.
Here we go again, day 2 of the Republicans’ jobs busting bill. #jobs #SoBeIt
