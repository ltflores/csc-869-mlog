Sad day as we all think of Gabby and use our words and prayers to remember the staff and innocent victims who were lost and injured.
I appreciate that BoyBlue took down the post and explained, recognizing that we all have to be careful, our words do matter.
I misspoke, the blog title was "dead to me" - sorry for the error.
Long day of sadness and shock for our country.  We're all hoping for Gabby's recovery and grieving for the families who lost loved ones.
My thoughts and prayers are with Gabby Giffords and the families of all the victims.  http://on.fb.me/f8ogEl

Big crowd at bill signing for DADT, very proud to be here and to have played even a small role in ending this discrimination!
Did some holiday shopping in Portland yesterday, glad to buy local!  That snow traffic backup on Commercial was slower than summer jams!
Back to DC on 6 am flight.  Hard to leave that pretty snow for another week of waiting for the Senate, let's hope it moves a little faster!
Great news on DADT, passes first vote in Senate!!  This could be a great year to end this unnecessary discrimination!
That should say 250 to 175 for DADT repeal in House!!
Repeal of DADT wins in the House 250    To 285!  Now it's up to the Senate & this discrimination will end - that would be a happy new year!

In Rules committee, preparing to bring the repeal of DADT to floor.  I hope to manage bill shortly.  Time to end this discrimination!
