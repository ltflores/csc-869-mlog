Repealing #HCR would increase the number of uninsured in the 13th District by 104,000 http://bit.ly/dFdGZc
Today I voted against repealing health care reform http://bit.ly/dFdGZc #HCR
If #HCR was repealed, new plans would no longer be required to cover preventative services, like mammograms + flu shots, w/out cost sharing.
If #HCR was repealed, 326,000 in NJ would not know if they are receiving value for their health insurance premium dollars.
If #HCR was repealed, 166 NJ employers would not be receiving help from the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program.
If #HCR was repealed, insurance companies could cut off insurance due to a single mistake on an application-326,000 in NJ  would be at risk.
Please join us at 11am EST in the nationwide moment of silence to honor @Rep_Giffords, her staff and the other victims of this tragedy
103,905 people on Medicare in NJ would see significantly higher prescription drug costs if #HCR was repealed.
If #HCR  was repealed, 27,800 young adults in NJ would lose their insurance coverage through their parents' health plans.
This Congress I am focused on job creation, our transportation systems, and livable communities. What issues are important to you?
If #HCR was repealed, Medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup. Nearly 1.3 m NJ seniors would have to pay extra to stay healthy
Repealing #HCR would mean  nearly 1.3 million NJ seniors who have Medicare would be forced to pay a copay for preventative services.
Just sworn in to the 112th Congress-- looking forward to serving the 13th District!
Repealing #HCR would mean nearly 5 million New Jerseyans would again be vulnerable to lifetime limits on what health insurers will pay.
