@JamesLeffler I will publicly admit that it was for a Thor comic.  I was curious! (But yeah Walking Dead has been a temptation too...)
Disappointed that I no longer get invited to be on the E3 Judges Panel. Just because I'd have voted for Bejeweled 3 doesn't mean I'm biased.
@AdamShear It's a great show. But it's exhausting. Especially when you're old and have been 14 times. :) But I hear ya!
I just bought my first ever digital comic from Marvel's iPad store. May this be the start of a beautiful and account-draining experience!
@Tomelet  I'm passing the Old Man of E3 Torch to you, gramps! Have fun with it!
@S1monJones very, very close. :)
@jazin1980 I will be all over PAX Prime, yes. :)
@The_Katbot I know. :(  It's not decided yet though!
@dreisiebzig Yeah, pretty much. That'd be the biggest reason TO go, i think.
@RnDmTask Yeah, but I'll be all over PAX Prime.  :)
@tole_cover Bingo. :D
Looks like I may be skipping E3 this year. Only the 2nd time in 15 YEARS. Not sure if I'm sad, or relieved.
I love PopCap fans! #RedVineGate #neverforget http://t.co/13loOjW

@KimAms I want to kill every one of those people on that home page photo.
