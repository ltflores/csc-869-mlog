@mikew808 as far as I know, it's only the devices shown on the netflix list. Launch the android market and let me know if you can download
@hollyhock well, it's a start. Better some phones than none. Again, the big F (fragmentation) gets in the way.
@DaveFriedel that's why I tweeted --- "only for 5 phones"
@Essli001 go to irc.twit.tv and enter a username. Have you done that?
@OMGEddieFTW last time I wasn't clear w/ function description I got questions.
@bloodroarXD yeah, that upset @raygun01 too
Yowza. Netflix for Android (on 5 phones) http://bit.ly/lN1vIZ Just launched it on my phone and it plays instant streaming!
@jonlech the show I work on @androidshow stopped by your booth at Google I/O. Love the NFC music sharing. We'll show it off tomorrow.
Putting my iOS hat back on, and since I missed @appslappyshow this week, Unpleasant Horse & Pulse (music game) apps are rocking my world.
@IanET well, good job today! And congrats on your demo working! @amtrekker
@Veronica i haven't and i don't remember any of our of listeners mentioning it, but I'm curious!
@hollyhock i think they wanted to :)
@calebstringer hmmm. I'm not sure.
Had a great time at @googleio, met a lot of great people & the energy was very positive. More on Friday when we record @androidshow. #io2011
@beilich can't remember. I think it was "Need for Speed"?
