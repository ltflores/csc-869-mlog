marcmaeder youre absolutely right our troops are doing an incredible job down there thank you for your service 
joining a conference call in a few minutes to discuss the gitmo trip today with members of the media 
it is unnerving to imagine housing these detainees on american soil 
its our troops who get abused by the detainees ie having feces thrown at them but they remain professional under constant mental stress 
our troops at gitmo are doing an incredible job dealing with these detainees 
just got back from spending the day visiting our troops and touring the facilities where we hold some of the most dangerous people on earth 
new blog about that dhs report httpisgdadxu 
just saw the premier of night at the museum 2 all the stars were there its better than the first one very creative funny lines 
heading to gitmo tomorrow to tour the detainee facilities and receive a briefing on detainee policy 
i hope the admin continues to keep the safety of our troops as a top priority and considers the safety of americans before closing gitmo 
the president is right to change his mind on the release of the detainee photos putting the safety of troops ahead of political posturing
