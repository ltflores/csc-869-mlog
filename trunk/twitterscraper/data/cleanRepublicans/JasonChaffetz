_katiemartin so true 
jimmilton i like the double meaninggood idea 
mabell45 that has potential let me work on that one 
holding a hearing requires a title what are your ideas for the title of the hearing it is about airport screening 
i passed legislation last year but the senate never considered it new legislation will be more comprehensive and address additional things 
yes there is legislation on its way working with transportation chairman mica he is very helpful and collaborative 
we need our airports to be more secure and less invasive we should not have to sacrifice our liberties to secure an airplane 
met briefly with tsa administrator pistole yesterday about the fiasco with id badges expect a hearing on that too

httpalturlcomq3npg here is my interaction this morning with the omb director at budget hearing tcot utpol 
headed to budget hearing with omb director 
headed on willis report on fox business tonight 
taxing borrowing and spending at the historic levels has proven big government will not grow the economy or create jobs fiscal restraint 
httpalturlcomjey38 some of the lowlights from the presidents desire to raise taxes 
i have been assured these 10 months will allow for hearings and markup amendments on pa if not i will vote no next time 
efbandy i probably shouldnt respond to that not yet 
jaseliberty that is an over simplification be very specific about problems show me in current legislation and will dive into it 
efbandy i would probably vote no if there are no hearings etc 
reynaldomacias i didnt suggest we would cast away the least among us but we are going to have to make tough choices 
jaseliberty catoinstitute cato is one of my favorites i wil work with them on this great group 
ralphgot i think you are wrong but i am an eternal optimist 
reynaldomacias we need to prioritize cant be all things to all people fed govt cant sustain spending nearly 1 of 4 in the country 
speckk thanks for being specific 10 month temp extension to work this out seems fair share other examples 
martian_mandi temp 10 month extension for 3 provisions to have time to make adjustment seems fair 
beehivetours specifically point where you have a problem with the pa and i will dive into it different now than when first introduced 
reynaldomacias meeting peoples basic needs should mean leaving their money in their pockets 
jaseliberty show me exactly where you find problems and i will look at it 
jaycehall show me exactly where you have concerns and i will look at it pa now is different than when originally introduced 
5sahandful fair enough very reasonable lets find where that doesnt happen and adjust accordingly thanks 
this is not a full reauthorization but does allow us to debate and modify the pa should have been done last year but did not 
tonight we vote again on patriot act pa i will vote for the temporary 10 month extension for the three provisions 
this week is the debate on the continuing resolution cr to fund fed govt for the rest of the fiscal year i have a few additional cuts 
the president continues to insist on growing government that is the wrong formula for growing our economy 
httpalturlcomzyqbq a major portion of the presidents savings come from tax increases 
hollie_robb i do think we need to cut funding for public television we cant afford it 
postalclerk3 sure ere are cuts needed in defense 
httpalturlcomrk277 less than 24 hrs before imf suggests move away from dollar fed chair says there is no chance of that happening 
httpalturlcom6mu2k this is a problem a big one yet in my next post see the fed chairman respond to my q from the day before 
going to be the speaker pro tempore this morning starting at 800am mst a first for me an honor 
going to question fed chair bernanke in a bit an hour perhaps
