climatebrad yeh they gave obama a nobel prize too i will take a look at the paper you sent have enjoyed the exchange 
greenman3610 jimmiebjr calling names and using generalities to dismiss specific arguments seems to be standard procedure for knowitalls 
climatebrad climate always changing cycles like those on sun co2 tiny factor now used as excuse for research grants power grab 
climatebrad even though emissions way up in 60s 70s scientists were recording a global cooling predicting catastrophic ice age 
climatebrad the insistence by scientific community on cooling in mid1970s reflects same attitude a disservice to science thennow 
climatebrad baseline doesnt impact on rate of change you claim its rapid start calculation at 1900 is it the same rate of increase 
caconservative1 too many caucuses lets see what they do to deserve my commitment of time and energy 
climatebrad didnt 70s egghead consensus warn of cooling is warming baseline end of miniice age low point in a 500 year temp decline 
climatebrad second straight failure cements my lack of faith in putting all our eggs in nasa basket call me a skepticbut not a denier 
i strongly agree rt presjpolk weve got to stop the patent reform act reps should be fighting it not rolling over httptcosxbknui 
trscoop reasonable pay and benefits for public employees no one at risk bankrupting compensation demands everybody at risk 
climatebrad thanks good discussion experts on both sides of your claimsclaims often changelike expected ocean raise like warm winter 
climatebrad pollutantharmful to humans co2no harm to people small impact of temp solar impact huge current cycle temps not alarming 
climatebrad man made pollution real its just not changing the climate co2 nonpollutant no threat to human health spurs food production 
climatebrad yes co2 is less than one half of one tenth of one percent of atmosphere and more than 80 percent of that is from nature 
climatebrad have spent considerable effort to get nasa others to focus on space debris rather than global warming 
climatebrad warpednine great call names rather than answer specific arguments prominent scientists on both sides global warming debate 
ucsusa everyone who disagrees is using talking points the tactics used by global warming advocates to silence disagreement is shameful 
climatebrad when they claim human activity is causing asteroids to threaten the earth and ill question that too 
itcaughtmyeye last years predictions 100 percent wrong why trust them for 25 years out in 1970s consensus was global cooling 
itcaughtmyeye prediction from same guys who warned of dry and warm winter got their phds in exaggeration and stiffling open discussion 
itcaughtmyeye yes frequent flier miles wont be canceled the price of fuel buying car parking wont shoot up backyard bbqs are safe

thatgirlca what you are really talking about is abortion ending the life of a yet to be born baby otherwise pp would have funding 
ucsusa u ignore issue incredible coincidence or solar whose head in sand read emails u trust your source warming has become change 
ucsusa your answer deceptive talks mars warming issue is earth and mars icecaps shrinking at same time coincidence or solar impact 
ucsusa guess ancient climate cycles like current one on marswhich mirrors changes on earth not product of sun but of human activity

catawu your name calling reflects arrogance and ignorance that does not deserve a reply and this is my last reply 
granpaowndog i speak and act directly there is no reason for us to push for a choice that will leave antifreedom radicals in charge 
turbokitty i support a free election to determine egypts next leaders why install a new gov before it is elected 
granpaowndog a september election time for moderates to organize radicals now ready demand to install new leaders now is stupid 
catawu not silly u ignore a huge factor that lowers the income of the american peoplemillion of illegals bidding down wages you care 
erindavern ollie is right liberals loudly support democracy movements that would topple friendly govs unlike when enemies are vulnerable 
those demanding mubarak go right now rather than after a free election later this year are putting us at risk egypt 
catawu you believe illegals are not bidding down wages that healtheducationcriminal justice systems not heavily impactedyou dont care 
mubarak outlined a workable plan for a new team of the egyptian peoples choice to take over democratically we should support this 
50plusoutofwork so many wonderful people suffer as a result of 2 decades of their own governments bad policies got set things straight 
catawu americansincluding the people of my areaevery race your approachracial analysis and name calling who is the racist here 
catawu racistsomeone whobecause of their race cant admit horrible impact tens of millions of illegals have on americans of all races 
catawu illegal immigrantsdomestic outsourcing sending jobs overseashiring cheaper illegal foreigners here the american people lose 
catrachonews the way to stand with the people is to ensure there is an honest election rather than letting a tough clique takeover 
mubarak should declare he nor his son will run in next years election pledge it will be free honest thus time for nonradicals egypt 
uscis_sloth we try our best to help constituents there is the flood of illegals into our country makes immigration harder to deal with 
pparkersv i have always given gw bush his share of the blame can you say the same about obama 
surfers say no fear obama has no shame rather than clarify his sotu speech blurred issues soturesponse 
ryanexpress77 absolutley right 
ryanexpress77 you are absolutely right current policy is insane 
gumbii3 full of it bigot thats how some people argue their case but you can do better than that make a point dont call names 
ryanexpress77 the sooner the better obama will veto it and the american people will better understand he is not on their side 
if you include illegals it will soon be 100 million without hope because it will attract more and break what is left of our economy
