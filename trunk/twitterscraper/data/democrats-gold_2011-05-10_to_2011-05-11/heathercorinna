Waking up, readying my mind as much as one can for 18 hrs of travel. Soon my whining ends.
Last night in London: perfectly mellow. Good food, good company, after the Dublin happy, too.
The tally of things left behind in 2 many places just took a sad turm. :-(( Travel is my enemy.
Soon 2 get on flight 6 of the 8 total this wk. Nearing the home stretch!
