@FrontierCare um, yeah. Embarrassingly enough. But I'm traveling for a week and have many events! Great flight!
@FrontierCare thanks! I hope the weight of my bag doesn't cause you to re-think the first bag flies free policy!
RT @apifeni: Great article re @DanaPerino Minute Mentoring events. LOVE that not a single mentor has ever said no to participating http://bit.ly/jKwVyn
Here at DCA many families of fallen police officers arriving for week's memorial activities. Keep them in your prayers - grieving hearts.
Bringing Minute Mentoring to Lincoln, Nebraska today!  Cindy Lange-Kubick: A mentor in a minute comes to Lincoln http://bit.ly/jKwVyn
Trying something different today - flying Frontier Airlines, a fave of @foxdavebriggs. On way to Lincoln, NE for a Minute Mentoring event!

Another good rule of thumb for comms - don't say an idea is "quite insane" if it's your boss's plan.  See debt ceiling/Goolsbee comments.
@TheBriefingRoom @Rep_Giffords well first I'd ask what you were smokin' cause that ain't gonna happen. ;)
@scottstanzel @georgewbush @defeat1098 those lucky ladies! ;)
Ad from- enviro group "fighting for a day when we can all breathe easier" Hope the "no garlic before train ride" movement makes to-do list.
@Keenerthanyou1 oh, well, safe to say your senators aren't gonna give a rip. Carly would have!
@amandacarpenter seriously. Not worth the time? Pray tell, what else will the Senate spend time talking about? Sure isn't job growth.
@Keenerthanyou1 not sure which state you are from, but I still think an actual call to a Congressional/Senate office is best.
