@josteinhh are you defending car lashes? Are these YOUR car lashes? :)
Car lashes. Seriously. I thought this was a YouTube joke, but it's real. http://instagr.am/p/ENAVv/
@ameyapendse this... is true.
I think I just agreed to a 6:15am Sunday news hit. I should probably make the coffee the night before...
@zzzoren awesome! which book are you on?
@zazealya that is not how a RT works. While it's a very nice sentiment, I did not say it.
@Guitardude2744 yay!
@zamn @mikebarish yes!!
Surely someone can make an HDTV version! “@mikebarish: It's a damn shame that future generations won't get to enjoy wood-paneled TVs.”
@outofocus @cosentino you should hear me and @joshlawrence sing that at karaoke sometime. We do even better.
@caseymckinnon haha, you wouldn't be the first!
@gregalor dude. sweet.
