Just voted no on Democrat takeover of health care. Will continue to voice my strong opposition to ObamaCare.
Obama, Pelosi still insist on ramming health care takeover through Congress. This big govt. plan wrong for Florida, wrong for nation.
Dems want to gamble with one-sixth of the U.S. economy with their health care plan. Americans reject it, so do I. Go to crenshaw.house.gov.
Pelosi and Obama want to take over heath care and raise your taxes. Didn't support their plan last fall and will vote against it again.
CBO: Dem health care plan costs $1 tillion, raises taxes, cuts Medicare, hikes insurance. GOP plan provides more access to affordable care.
In Nancy Pelosi’s alternative universe, House doesn’t need to vote on healthcare reform to pass it. Read WSJ OP-ED at http://bit.ly/cwBHYN
With another healthcare vote soon, House GOP plan meets the president's goals for reform, without a government takeover of health care.

@greenman3610 @jimmiebjr calling names and using generalities to dismiss specific arguments seems to be standard procedure for know-it-alls
@climatebrad Climate always changing. Cycles, like those on sun. Co2 tiny factor now used as excuse for research grants & power grab.
@climatebrad  Even though emissions way up in 60s& 70s scientists were recording a global cooling & predicting catastrophic ice age.
@climatebrad The insistence by scientific community on cooling in mid-1970s reflects same attitude, a disservice to science then&now.
@climatebrad Baseline doesn't impact on rate of change? You claim its "rapid." Start calculation at 1900 is it the same rate of increase?
@CAconservative1 Too many caucuses. Let's see what they do to deserve my commitment of time and energy.
@climatebrad  Didn't 70s egghead consensus warn of cooling? Is warming baseline end of mini-ice age, low point in a 500 year temp decline?
@climatebrad  Second straight failure cements my lack of faith in putting all our eggs in NASA basket.  Call me a skeptic(but not a denier)

@trscoop Reasonable pay and benefits for public employees= no one at risk. Bankrupting compensation demands= everybody at risk.
@climatebrad Thanks, good discussion. Experts on both sides of your claims&claims often change,like expected ocean raise, like warm winter
@climatebrad pollutant=harmful to humans. CO2=no harm to people& small impact of temp. Solar impact huge. Current cycle temps not alarming
@climatebrad Man made pollution real, its just not changing the climate. CO2 non-pollutant, no threat to human health, spurs food production
@climatebrad Yes, CO2 is less than one half of one tenth of one percent of atmosphere and more than 80 percent of that is from nature.
@climatebrad Have spent considerable effort to get NASA& others to focus on Space debris rather than Global Warming.
@climatebrad @WarpedNine Great, call names rather than answer specific arguments. Prominent scientists on both sides Global warming debate.
@UCSUSA Everyone who disagrees is using talking points? The tactics used by  Global warming advocates to silence disagreement is shameful
@climatebrad When they claim human activity is causing asteroids to threaten the earth and I'll question that too.
@itcaughtmyeye Last year's predictions 100 percent wrong. Why trust them for 25 years out. In 1970s consensus was global cooling.
@itcaughtmyeye Prediction from same guys who warned of dry and warm winter, got their PhDs in exaggeration and stiffling open discussion

@Song1964 Family reunification can take place in another country so obviously family reunification is less important than immigration to USA
@USCIS_Sloth OK
@conservcompend Thanks for the thanks. I'm sure we'll find ourselves on the same side of most issues. As for the others OPEN YOUR EYES,haha
@conservcompend you are clearly focused on theory. Open your eyes. Should we have forced IBM not to provide cutting edge tech to Hitler? yes
@conservcompend To sell in China it has had to be manufactured in China=value added wealth only flows to China.
@ThompsonAnthony One or two simple amendments would correct short commings. Not permitting vote to amend bill is not acceptable
@conservcompend open your eyes. Letting Chinese dictators  make the rules has empowered & enriched them at the expense of  American people
I'll be on House Floor in 7 minutes talking about why I'm opposing the #PatriotAct Extension - http://cs.pn/fNFPPz

@catawu your name calling reflects arrogance and ignorance that does not deserve a reply. And this is my last reply.
@granpaowndog I speak and act directly. There is no reason for US to push for a choice that will leave anti-freedom radicals in charge.
@TurboKitty  I support a free election to determine Egypt's next leaders. Why install a new gov before it is elected?
@granpaowndog A September election= time for moderates to organize. Radicals now ready . Demand to install new leaders now is stupid.
@catawu Not silly. U ignore a huge factor that lowers the income of the American people:million of illegals bidding down wages. You care?
@ErinDavern Ollie is right! Liberals loudly support democracy movements that would topple friendly govs, unlike when enemies are vulnerable
Those demanding Mubarak go right now, rather than after a free election later this year are putting us at risk. #Egypt
@catawu You believe illegals are not bidding down wages? That health,education&criminal justice systems not heavily impacted?You don't care?
Mubarak outlined a workable plan for a new team, of the Egyptian people's choice, to take over democratically. We should support this.
@50plusoutofwork. So many wonderful people suffer as a result of 2 decades of their own government's bad policies. Got set things straight.
@catawu Americans(including the people of my area)=every race. Your approach=racial analysis and name calling. Who is the racist here?
.@catawu Racist=someone who,because, of their race, can't admit horrible impact tens of millions of illegals have on Americans of all races.
@catawu Illegal immigrants=domestic outsourcing. Sending jobs overseas=hiring cheaper illegal foreigners here. The American people lose.
@CatrachoNews The way to stand with the people is to ensure there is an honest election rather than letting a tough clique takeover.
Mubarak should declare he nor his son will run in next year's election & pledge it will be free & honest, thus time for non-radicals. #Egypt
@USCIS_Sloth We try our best to help constituents. There is the flood of illegals into our country makes immigration harder to deal with.
@pparkersv I have always given GW Bush his share of the blame. Can you say the same about Obama?
Surfers say NO FEAR,  Obama has NO SHAME.  Rather than clarify, his #SOTU speech blurred issues. #SOTUresponse
@Ryanexpress77 Absolutley right!!!
@Ryanexpress77 You are absolutely right. Current policy is insane.
@gumbii3 "full of it" & "bigot" That's how some people argue their case, but you can do better than that.  Make a point don't call names
@Ryanexpress77  The sooner the better. Obama will veto it and the American people will better understand he is not on their side.
If you include illegals it will soon be 100 million without hope because it will attract more and break what is left of our economy.

@SUPnazi760 China's regime has made suckers out of our well meaning,warm and fuzzy leaders. America now pays the price or such none sense.
@mikeytheshow Bush and Obama are not gangsters or Nazis. The same can not be said of China's President and his henchmen.

@wajobu i see where you're coming from and understand your skepticism.  all i can do is share what we're doing, why and deliver results
@wajobu government does not do that today: understand real impact of its actions, back it up with facts, and answer "is this worth it?"
@wajobu and that's what we need to know: which taxes? which regulations? then we use hard data to balance cost vs benefit
@wajobu which is, sadly, the hard-working #smallbusiness men and women of America.  We must hear their challenges to fix what's unecessary
@wajobu can you at least give us the benefit of the doubt? we're trying to bring everyone into the conversation, especially those not heard
@wajobu part of that problem is there's no way to listen to #smallbusiness effectively.  that's where americanjobcreators.com comes in.
@wajobu some are from corporations, many (if not most) are from #smallbusiness, that creates most jobs and opportunity in america
@wajobu fact is, you can't tell me what #regulations are necessary and what aren't based on data.  can any one? that's why we are asking
@wajobu how so? all we're asking is what #regulations hold back job creators from one woman startups on up
@wajobu you aren't addressing my point...do you think what we're doing makes sense?
@wajobu but when gov't regulates everything, it regulates nothing effectively or efficiently (see: #oilspill, housing collapse)
@wajobu i don't disagree with you...Team Oversight was on folks who let #Oilspill happen years ago. same w/ fannie/freddie's regulator
@wajobu gov't doesn't understand it's impact, though, on workers/families/businesses.  we must change that: americanjobcreators.com
@wajobu that's why we need your help at AmericanJobCreators.com.  We need hard data on what regs help and hurt to target our work.
@wajobu some regs are necessary. some are not. can you tell the difference?
@DCdoozy hope i don't fall into that category...thanks for the the thank you

According to SBA, the cost of complying with the tax code is 66 percent higher for small businesses than for large businesses.
Tax compliance is already a major expense for small biz. 1099 requirement will substantially increase these costs.
1099 requirement discourages small businesses from hiring new workers. We cannot afford to slow job creation.
1099 requirement will hit small businesses hard, forcing them to redirect resources to the IRS instead of adding jobs.
The House will vote to repeal 1099 tax provision from HC law today. This provision will stifle growth if it is not repealed.
Only 47 members of the House voted for every spending cut during the FY 11 funding debate.  http://ow.ly/42QeS

Deficit reduction? The HC law taxes for 10 yrs to pay for 6 yrs of service. It will add trillions of dollars to existing federal liabilities
HC repeal today. According to the Administration, the federal gov't will spend $310 billion more under HC law than we would have without it.
Vote to repeal the job-killing healthcare law tomorrow. HC law included nearly $570 billion in tax increases that will hurt job creation.

Since taking office, the President has increased gov't spending by 84% in non-defense discretionary spending over two years. #tcot

President's budget increases taxes by more than $2 trillion.  How is this supposed to create jobs? #tcot#gop
The President's $3.8 trillion budget is more spending, more barrowing, more taxes, more deficits, and more debt.#tcot
Orszag and Geithner are going to tesitfy before W&M today to justify the President's $3.8 Trillion budget.  It triples the national debt.

Bailout funds are going to be used for second stimulus.  If paid off today, interest on bailout money would cost Americans $141 billion.
First stimulus cost $250K per job “saved or created.” Growing the federal government will not turn our economy around.#tcot
The new stimulus is another missed opportunity to help Americans get back to work and another example of the disconnect in Washington.
Not a single hearing was held on new stimulus. No input by the states such as Nevada which have been most affected by economic downturn.
Second stimulus is a repeat of the first. Nation is at 10% unemployment, Nevada at 13% unemployment. First stimulus did not work.#tcot
Second stimulus will be voted on today. Congress has spent months on health care, but will only dedicate a day to economic recovery. #tcot
I offered a second motion to allow death tax to expire beyond next year.  It was defeated on a party line vote.
I offered a motion to permanently repeal the death tax.  Dems rejected on procedural grounds.
A full repeal of the death tax will create jobs and expand investment.  Congress should stop adopting policies that hurt economic recovery.
In 2001, Congress promised to repeal the death tax.  Congress should keep a promise for once. #tcot
Death tax has a negative impact on family farms, ranches and small businesses which are often passed down from one generation to the next.
The death tax bill is nothing more than a preemptive tax increase to prevent the expiration of the death tax next year. #tcot
Today’s death tax bill permanently sets the estate tax at 45%.  Congress should permanently repeal this tax. #tcot

As we debate painful budget cuts, ask yourself if there better ways to spend tax dollars than on stimulus road signs. The answer is yes.
Every dollar the Fed Gov’t spends has an advocate, but I’m here to be the advocate for the struggling taxpayer who says enough is enough.

Raising taxes on gas when prices have already blown through $3/gallon isn't the answer. Let's not kill one industry to build the next. #SOTU

@good4politics @Gogoette Yeah.  That might be a bit much for a hearing, but I know what you are getting at
@_katiemartin So true!
@jimmilton I like the double meaning.....good idea
@MaBell45 That has potential.  Let me work on that one.
Holding a hearing requires a title.  What are your ideas for the title of the hearing?  It is about airport screening.
I passed legislation last year but the Senate never considered it.  New legislation will be more comprehensive and address additional things
Yes, there is legislation on its way.  Working with Transportation Chairman Mica.  He is very helpful and collaborative.
We need our airports to be more secure and less invasive.  We should not have to sacrifice our liberties to secure an airplane.
Met briefly with TSA Administrator Pistole yesterday about the fiasco with I.D. badges.  Expect a hearing on that too.
I look forward to the first in a series of hearings my sub-committee will hold on TSA. Happens in two weeks.  :)
Went through TSA airport security screening tonight with Ron Paul. I managed to earn an extensive pat-down after refusing whole body imaging

Taxing, borrowing, and spending at the historic levels has proven big government will not grow the economy or create jobs.  Fiscal restraint
http://alturl.com/jey38 Some of the lowlights from the President's desire to raise taxes
I have been assured these 10 months will allow for hearings and mark-up (amendments) on P.A. If not, I will vote NO next time.
@efbandy I probably shouldn't respond to that.  Not yet....
@jaseliberty That is an over simplification.  Be very specific about problems.  Show me in current legislation and will dive into it
@efbandy I would probably vote no if there are no hearings, etc.
@reynaldomacias I didn't suggest we would cast away the least among us, but we are going to have to make tough choices
@jaseliberty @CatoInstitute Cato is one of my favorites.  I wil work with them on this.  Great group.
@ralphgot I think you are wrong, but I am an eternal optimist
@reynaldomacias We need to prioritize.  Can't be all things to all people. Fed govt can't sustain spending nearly 1 of 4 $ in the country
@SpecKK Thanks for being specific. 10 month temp extension to work this out seems fair.  Share other examples
@martian_mandi Temp 10 month extension for 3 provisions to have time to make adjustment seems fair.
@BEEHIVETOURS Specifically point where you have a problem with the PA and I will dive into it.  Different now than when first introduced
@reynaldomacias Meeting people's basic needs should mean leaving their money in their pockets.
@jaseliberty Show me exactly where you find problems and I will look at it.
@JayceHall Show me exactly where you have concerns and I will look at it.  PA now is different than when originally introduced
@5sahandful Fair enough.  Very reasonable.  Let's find where that doesn't happen and adjust accordingly.  Thanks,
This is not a full reauthorization, but does allow us to debate and modify the P.A. Should have been done last year but did not.
Tonight we vote again on Patriot Act (P.A.). I will vote for the temporary 10 month extension for the three provisions.
This week is the debate on the continuing resolution (CR to fund fed govt for the rest of the fiscal year).  I have a few additional cuts
The President continues to insist on growing government.  That is the wrong formula for growing our economy.
http://alturl.com/zyqbq. A major portion of the President's "savings" come from tax increases.
@Hollie_Robb I do think we need to cut funding for public television.  We can't afford it.
@postalclerk3 Sure.  Ere are cuts needed in Defense.
http://alturl.com/rk277 Less than 24 hrs before IMF suggests move away from dollar, Fed Chair says there is no chance of that happening

I remain committed to leading with #KSCommonSense and to making tough choices so our children & grandchildren can dream big & pursue them.
I came to DC because we are to be stewards of what we’re given & to pass on to the next generation the life we love & lead #maidenspeech
We have before us today an opportunity to set the games of politics aside and work together to confront the enormous challenges before us.
Lastly, we need to repeal the flawed #hcr & replace it w/ commonsense changes that reduce costs, & promote choice in our health care system
To meet our nation’s energy needs we must develop traditional sources; encourage development of renewable energy; & encourage conservation
For the U.S. to remain competitive in a global market, Congress must also develop a comprehensive energy policy #maidenspeech
History shows that econ. growth starts w/ the private sector. DC must create an environment where entrepreneurship & businesses can flourish
This is a challenge we can't ignore. We must pursue reform but this will take the leadership of Pres Obama & the willingness of both parties
In addition to living by a budget, we must also address our long-term unfunded liabilities, such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare
The best way to get our spending under control is to actually set a budget and stick to it #maidenspeech
Congress can and should do what Kansans do every day: make decisions based on solid values and real accountability #maidenspeech
Truth is out-of-control borrowing & spending has real consequences on our lives: inflation, high interest, less growth/jobs #maidenspeech
Not a revenue problem, it's a spending problem. Experience shows that more money raised by DC results in more spending in DC #maidenspeech
Our gov borrows 40 cents of every $ it spends and half our debt is held by foreigners, many who do not share our interests. #maidenspeech
"We’ve come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. We must act now to protect future generations."Reagan. I issue the same warning

And most of all thanks to all of you who spoke up, called your senator and demanded an end to reckless big spending Washington!
Thanks to the Republican appropriators who stood up against this pork-filled omnibus bill.
Too embarrassed to read their own spending bill, Dems have agreed to a short-term CR, funding government at current levels without earmarks.
Reid finally admitted he didn't have the votes to pass it and is withdrawing Dem pork-filled omnibus.
Unprecedented: Congress has never passed major arms treaty in lame duck http://bit.ly/hNIZrv

Dems want to ram through the 1,924 page spending bill before Christmas, but I'll join w/ other GOP to make them read it on the Senate floor.

@marcmaeder You're absolutely right. Our troops are doing an incredible job down there. Thank you for your service.
Joining a conference call in a few minutes to discuss the Gitmo trip today with members of the media.
It is unnerving to imagine housing these detainees on American soil.
It's our troops who get abused by the detainees: ie having feces thrown at them. But they remain professional under constant mental stress.
Our troops at Gitmo are doing an incredible job dealing with these detainees.
Just got back from spending the day visiting our troops and touring the facilities where we hold some of the most dangerous people on Earth.
New blog: About That DHS Report http://is.gd/AdxU
Just saw the premier of Night at the Museum 2. All the stars were there. It's better than the first one ... very creative, funny lines.
Heading to Gitmo tomorrow to tour the detainee facilities and receive a briefing on detainee policy.
I hope the Admin. continues to keep the safety of our troops as a top priority and considers the safety of Americans before closing Gitmo.
The President is right to change his mind on the release of the detainee photos; putting the safety of troops ahead of political posturing.
@stuart_oneill The DC Scholarship program is for children in grades K-12.
Just finished up blogger call about card check with National Review, NowHampshire, Townhall.com and others. #tcot #EFCAFail #EFCA #cardcheck
The NEA refused to show up to defend their opposition to the DC Scholarship program.
Ronald, the Deputy Youth Mayor of DC, said why not give poor kids a chance to succeed. Let's put our kids before special interests.
5 years ago we started giving low income kids money to go to private schools. We just heard from some of them asking us to keep the program.

Too many of our Justices today have been citing international law as a reason to reinterpret our Constitution. I couldn't disagree more.
At the very least that person should hold our Constitution as the supreme law over any international law.

@EricLykins Thank you!
Right now, we're understandably focused on opposing. I want to win the majority & get to proposing. Some Rs will find it hard to transition
So if we take the majority, we'd better have some folks who have plans and who can warmly sell those plans by capturing hearts and minds.
While in the minority it's largely about opposing the D agenda. If we take  the majority, the job changes to proposing rather than opposing.
Interesting conversation tonight with a tea party organizer. We talked about how job description will change if the GOP takes control.

We've got to be bold! We've got to say "NO!" to $150 million recreational lakes. And we've got to be ready to explain entitlement reform.
Solutions or scapegoats? You get to choose today. We can STOP THE SPENDING with a bold plan like Paul Ryan's Roadmap for America's future.
Read all about pork, earmarks, the Union lake and fishing for votes:  http://wurl.ws/y6OQ
Little Pigs. Little pork. Little earmark for a recreational lake. No go with one lady: "When you get to your credit limit STOP THE SPENDING!
Just left Little Pigs' new location in Greer. Union Lake was main topic. Folks were fired up--ready to STOP THE SPENDING.
Also heard encouragement as to my voting record and discernment that we don't want to throw out those who have worked to balance the budget.
Great door-to-door in Augusta Circle area just now. Found enthusiastic response and got out lots of signs. "Stop the spending!" is the word!
Everyone: Stop the spending!
Really great door-to-door conversations in Greer just now. James: grow the jobs. Mark: find solutions. Bill: secure the border.
Very encouraging that people seem to be deciding to keep in office those who are prepared to stop the spending & a voting record to prove it
Just finishing door-to-door in Botany Woods in Greenville. Rain delayed the action for awhile, but then some very encouraging conversations
Originally from Ghana and living in NYC, he joined the Marines after 9/11. Became US citizen after second deployment. Wow, what an American!
As always happens at these events, I wish that he had spoken an I had listened. He was deployed 4 times to Iraq. Lost his right eye in 4th.
Spoke at two great Memorial Day events today. After the event at Greenville County Square a former Marine thanked me for speaking.
Mr. Joe Hudson died 3 years ago. "We were very close," Mrs. Hudson told me. "He went through a lot." On Memorial Day remember Joe Hudson.
Came home. No hospital beds. Had to wait. Recovered somewhat. Worked @ Steele Heddle for a time. Never quite well. Married 64 years.
Joe Hudson went in @ Normandy. Made it into countryside before being shot in chest and legs. Six ribs gone, medics covered heart with skin.
Just heard an inspiring account of love and devotion as I was going door-to-door off Parkins Mill Road in Greenville from Mrs. Joe Hudson.
Sadly, the other R and the D acknowledged that inaction takes us to Greece. We deserve better. We deserve a Congress ready to lead.
I asked if they (the other R and the D) were ready to cast votes and lead to solutions. "Heck no!" came the answer, "We'd lose our seats."
Amazed by what another R & a D told me in conversation on Floor. All agreed that people are mad. All agreed that big decisions must be made.
It's going to take more than 1200 to secure the border. We should get on with it. That's the first step in restoring the rule of law.
Glad that Pres. Obama will send 1200 troops to border. We can thank Arizona for re-starting a push that should never have stopped.
To see some beautiful girls (they got their Mom's looks and abilities) on a TV commercial, take a look at this: http://wurl.ws/tA0P
Health care reform should start with tort reform. If you're not clear about that, you shouldn't represent this district in Washington.
Meanwhile, I've voted for caps & support an even more sweeping proposal that I learned from SRHS on my 75-stop/9 month health care tour.
Ya think that lawyer cash might keep Gowdy from answering the Medical Society's question about tort reform? Got the garbled answer on tape!
Gowdy has raised $75,000 from lawyers (19% of his campaign cash). See  http://www.opensecrets.org/races/sectors.php?cycle=2010&id=SC04
Ironic that just next door is "The Lawyers Building" which houses some trial lawyers. Lo and behold there's a "Gowdy" sign out front!
Just met (in front of Greenville County Medical Society) with physicians who heard Trey Gowdy's non-answer on tort reform last Tuesday night
And the chances of me being for a $150 million earmark for a recreational lake? Zero.
Not my style to build false hope. Better to be straight up and tell folks the truth: Union lake can only be built with an earmark.
I admit to not fitting in w/ Washington-style politics: Build false hope in a "competitive grant" process for a "public private partnership"
No, I researched the proposed Lake w/ the Corps of Engineers and they told me bluntly: we will build the lake only if forced by an earmark
If it were simply a public/private partnership seeking a competitive grant for a 5,700 acre recreational lake, why would I have opposed it?
It's time to take a look at all that trial lawyer money Trey's gotten. It's time to ask why those trial lawyers are investing so heavily.
Gowdy didn't get away with the non-answer on tort reform tonight. The doctors were onto him. They heard a non-answer & talked to me about it
Amazing that Trey just had another chance to turn his tort reform lecture into a position, but he didn't.
