Headed on Fox News with Neil Cavuto today
@good4politics @Gogoette Yeah.  That might be a bit much for a hearing, but I know what you are getting at
@_katiemartin So true!
@jimmilton I like the double meaning.....good idea
@MaBell45 That has potential.  Let me work on that one.
Holding a hearing requires a title.  What are your ideas for the title of the hearing?  It is about airport screening.
I passed legislation last year but the Senate never considered it.  New legislation will be more comprehensive and address additional things
Yes, there is legislation on its way.  Working with Transportation Chairman Mica.  He is very helpful and collaborative.
We need our airports to be more secure and less invasive.  We should not have to sacrifice our liberties to secure an airplane.
Met briefly with TSA Administrator Pistole yesterday about the fiasco with I.D. badges.  Expect a hearing on that too.
I look forward to the first in a series of hearings my sub-committee will hold on TSA. Happens in two weeks.  :)
Went through TSA airport security screening tonight with Ron Paul. I managed to earn an extensive pat-down after refusing whole body imaging
@stacyqc @normative @kashhill  Whoa is right!  Thanks for pointing out this story.  He has been a good writer on this issue.  Thank you!
@AnmerInSLC Working on it daily.  Hang in there with us.  More to come
@gopTODD Thanks, Todd.  I appreciate it

http://alturl.com/d8ctf  Details of my bill to have fed workers and contractors pay their taxes. #tcot #utpol
If they don't pay their taxes, they should not be paid by the federal taxpayers.
Introducing bills this morning to make sure fed employees and contractors pay their taxes. #tcot #utpol
Glad to be on this list. http://alturl.com/vzgfm  Who wants to cut #tcot #utpol
http://alturl.com/z9nd9 @RepWeiner You can always count on A.W. for quotable quotes
@bludworth They are now.  Whoa!  Thanks for bringing it to my attention.  We are going to dive into this
@RebeccaCP This has to stop.  Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@RebeccaCP That is crazy.  Did you film this.  If you know who is in the video, please contact me.  I would like to speak with them.
RT @RebeccaCP: @jasoninthehouse Pls ask TSA why we are now patted down/searched AFTER leaving a TRAIN! Makes no sense and it's wrong!  h ...
@rjvanbib That story has wrong written all over it.  We have added it to our list of items to follow up with...
@_katiemartin Thanks for the lead.  We will follow up.
http://alturl.com/ws74s  This is crazy.  Add this to the list of Qs I have the TSA.  Hearings to start in March.
.@Jim_Jordan is one of my favorites.  Read George Will's article about him http://alturl.com/5n5jv #tcot #utpol
Another very late night in the House as we continue debate on CR
http://alturl.com/drfkk It has been two years since the Stimulus vote.  The SL Tribune gets reaction
@johnjhodges Thank you.  I appreciate it
http://alturl.com/wbt67 Wall Street Journal writes about how the House has changed for the better
http://alturl.com/vr3qm  Article about my push for spending cuts #utpol #tcot
Fun to have success. Saves more than $40 mil per year, but still a long way to go to permanently defund
Pleased with the success we had passing an amendment to defund the US Institute of Peace.  Worked with @RepWeiner & @RepChipCravaack
Going on the Lou Dobbs radio program
@scott_rapoport That was funny.  Yeah, off the Floor of House of Representatives.
4:04am.  Just got off the Floor.  More work on the Continuing Resolution (CR) in a few hours.
@LizMair Thanks.  I appreciate it.  A bit over the top
@Akhildesai @lawrence Thank you.  I appreciate it.
@Rushlimbang @lawrence Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Actually, roughly $640,000
@LadyLogician Amen.  Will do!
@martineznatalia Continuing Resolution.  No budget done last year, so how the funding happens for remaining 7 months.
House is debating C.R. late into the night.  I will be in the Chair starting at midnight EST until 2:00am or later.
.@RepWeiner Your pic is awesome.  I don't have one of me at that age, but see Ralph Macchio aka Karate Kid. It was that bad.
@RepWeiner You and me, of course.  Kudos to Rep Weiner, of course
http://alturl.com/uvx29  Thanks to The Hill for letting me publish this op-ed on the need to cut spending.  #tcot #utpol
http://alturl.com/ur95f Thanks to the Wall Street Journal for posting our bi-partisan op-ed and effort to eliminate US Institute of Peace
http://alturl.com/wxtp5  My bill to sell excess real property, $19 Billion worth of buildings, etc. #tcot #utpol
Scheduled to be on MSNBC at just after 4:00pm.  Then on Fox Business' Freedom Watch tonight. #tcot #utpol
http://alturl.com/q3npg Here is my interaction this morning with the OMB Director at Budget hearing. #tcot #utpol
Headed to budget hearing with OMB Director
Headed on Willis Report on Fox Business tonight
Taxing, borrowing, and spending at the historic levels has proven big government will not grow the economy or create jobs.  Fiscal restraint
http://alturl.com/jey38 Some of the lowlights from the President's desire to raise taxes
I have been assured these 10 months will allow for hearings and mark-up (amendments) on P.A. If not, I will vote NO next time.
@efbandy I probably shouldn't respond to that.  Not yet....
@jaseliberty That is an over simplification.  Be very specific about problems.  Show me in current legislation and will dive into it
@efbandy I would probably vote no if there are no hearings, etc.
@reynaldomacias I didn't suggest we would cast away the least among us, but we are going to have to make tough choices
@jaseliberty @CatoInstitute Cato is one of my favorites.  I wil work with them on this.  Great group.
@ralphgot I think you are wrong, but I am an eternal optimist
@reynaldomacias We need to prioritize.  Can't be all things to all people. Fed govt can't sustain spending nearly 1 of 4 $ in the country
@SpecKK Thanks for being specific. 10 month temp extension to work this out seems fair.  Share other examples
@martian_mandi Temp 10 month extension for 3 provisions to have time to make adjustment seems fair.
@BEEHIVETOURS Specifically point where you have a problem with the PA and I will dive into it.  Different now than when first introduced
@reynaldomacias Meeting people's basic needs should mean leaving their money in their pockets.
@jaseliberty Show me exactly where you find problems and I will look at it.
@JayceHall Show me exactly where you have concerns and I will look at it.  PA now is different than when originally introduced
@5sahandful Fair enough.  Very reasonable.  Let's find where that doesn't happen and adjust accordingly.  Thanks,
This is not a full reauthorization, but does allow us to debate and modify the P.A. Should have been done last year but did not.
Tonight we vote again on Patriot Act (P.A.). I will vote for the temporary 10 month extension for the three provisions.
This week is the debate on the continuing resolution (CR to fund fed govt for the rest of the fiscal year).  I have a few additional cuts
The President continues to insist on growing government.  That is the wrong formula for growing our economy.
http://alturl.com/zyqbq. A major portion of the President's "savings" come from tax increases.
@Hollie_Robb I do think we need to cut funding for public television.  We can't afford it.
@postalclerk3 Sure.  Ere are cuts needed in Defense.
http://alturl.com/rk277 Less than 24 hrs before IMF suggests move away from dollar, Fed Chair says there is no chance of that happening
http://alturl.com/6mu2k This is a problem.  A big one.  Yet in my next post see the Fed Chairman respond to my Q from the day before
Going to be the Speaker pro tempore this morning starting at 8:00am MST.  A first for me.  An honor.
Going to question Fed Chair Bernanke in a bit.  An hour perhaps.
