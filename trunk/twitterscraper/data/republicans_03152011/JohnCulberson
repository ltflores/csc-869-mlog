Happy to be home for the holidays in Texas - having a great lunch @ Luby's @ 290/Cypress w Belinda & Caroline- Now for last minute shopping!
I feel like it's Christmas Eve! I can't sleep anticipating the great, good things that will happen when Pelosi's House is swept away.
@evan7257 ?????
American common sense/core principles will sweep away Pelosi's liberal Congress in a tidal wave. I hope it's an asteroid extinction event!
@buszero Firing Nancy Job 1, Firing Obama Job 2 but restoring the American Republic w a limited federal Govt under Constit highest priority!
@robleeper not sure what your question was about higher ed plz resend.
@handeman420 As for me: restore indiv freedom & State sov underthe 10th Amend=get feds out of our lives out of our pockets=leave us alone!
@airbrat77 Only the President can fire them but Appropriators like me will zero out Obama's illegal czars so they have no money to operate.
@ecrosstexas u r right - if entrusted w a 2nd chance, House Repubs will keep our word to cut spending&taxes&roll back federal power
If Repubs win the majority, Pelosi is fired day 1. Next: defund, repeal & replace Obamacare; cut spending/taxes; 0 out czars & cap&tax etc.

@trevorsg Good to hear from you! I wish you all the best.
@oscarneo support Consitutional conservatives who pledge to strictly follow the Constitution - that is the key
@rich_pav Of course - Thomas Jefferson often said "apply core principles (of the Constitution) and the knot will always untie itself."
Itis exciting to see America wake up & prepare to reaffirm our Constitution's core principles by sweeping out Pelosi & her liberal majority!
@less_tx Lucky for both of us - my old computers are in the storage locker!
@miss_chicks I assume you mean that spammers etc would prob have near zero followers but mass quantities of tweets - logical - Ty!
I have fixed the account - very aggravating!
If you got a weird tweet from me ignore it & do not click on the hyperlinks -they are prob viruses- my account was hacked by robospammers
@airbrat77 Mad Americans using Twitter & Qik were decisive in making Pelosi do a 180 flip & suddenly decide to permit offshore drilling 2008
@TexasBlindJack remember 5 1/4 floppy discs? My Kaypro still boots up & runs the old Wordstar - can't bear to throw it or the Lisa/SE out!
I have missed these spontaneous conversations - this is a wonderful tool once I figure out out how to boot trolls etc as I have on Facebook
@DavidGuenthner I will find it & download it to my iPad - thank you!
I still have the Lisa & my first Mac SE which was my next computer in 1986.  I also still have my very first computer, a Kaypro CPM machine
@DavidGuenthner So Tweetdeck is the key to friendly and useful conversations? I want to block trolls & spam - can Tweetdeck help?

Plus I am hooked on my iPad - revolutionary device - transformed personal computing forever -  same feeling I had in 1985 with my 1st LISA.
Thanks for quick & very kind responses. I got tired of endless spam & mindless trolls. How do you filter these out & focus on friends?
I am going to try Twitter again to see if I can filter out trolls & spam & focus on friends & respectful, thoughtful opponents.
It has been far too long since I visited Twitter - I have been using Facebook regularly and Qik - I will start posting here again

@JosephTX Thanks Joseph! and thanks again for the wonderful book on Texas lawmen - it is a terrific book
@worstrootcanale Ugh! this is a new one I am unfamiliar with - sounds awful - wouldn't state dental boards handle this under 10th Amend?
@thecivilright TY!
@polyhazard Taxpayers are outraged bcz they are very well informed: social media allows us to see/hear what Obama/Pelosi r doing w/o filter
I am broadcasting live on the Houston Chronicle's website - http://tinyurl.com/ykakrs7
I am at Monticello about to begin our tour -
@JLVernonPhD that's why he used lower case, as I did in quoting him.
@JosephTX partly cloudly cool - wonderful!
I posted that too fast - Jefferson said on ANY problem "if you apply republican principles the knot will untie itself."
Jefferson often said that what the problem was, if you "apply republican principles (i.e. follow the Constit) the knot will untie itself."
On my way to Monticello to meet w fellow conserv to coord plan to restore 10th Amend indiv freedom/state sovereignty as Jefferson intended
My best wishes to you and your family for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2010!
@donnakay2010 I will - it looks very weird - I will analyze it carefully - no police officer in USA should ever be exempt from Constit
@kmita3 I will look into it - looks very weird - I will analyze it carefully - no police officer in USA should ever be exempt from Constit
@TellTheTruth1 I will - it looks very weird - I will analyze it carefully - no police officer in USA should ever be exempt from Constit

@jeffw171 America urgently needs a true fiscal conservative majority in Congress dedicated to strict adherence to the Constitution
@DBranch44 please read the Daily Telegraph story
@notABBY his article is right on target - we need to use the same rules as Israel on ports of entry & our borders
@maryb1161 please read the Daily Telegraph article - it is accurate - how can you not be upset?
@zenpundit I will - good suggestion -thanks
@paulvalach thank you Paul...I hope you & your family have a healthy happy & prosperous 2010!
@EconGrrl please read the Daily Telegraph article - it is accurate
This is a very important post from Cheryl Smith that every parent should read: http://www.culturesmithconsulting.com/news/
@evan7257 I did not have room to say former speaker - but I did on my Facebook post
@jeffw171 - I agree which is why I voted against over $2.6 trillion in Bush spending proposals - Note I said we need a CONSERVATIVE majority
Speaker Ginrich is right on target in his article, but only a conserv maj in Congress will do what must be done: http://tinyurl.com/yff42od
Forget politics: our survival &our families' safety is too important: we must stop Obama/Holder/Pelosi to win war http://tinyurl.com/ycmqgvu
I agree with Speaker Newt Gingrich, and will do everything in my power to carry out his common sense proposals: http://tinyurl.com/yff42od

@davidhust I have had more people recommend Tweetie than Tweetdeck but will try them both
@AjntB2Sli I agree - plus while we are at it, let's also zero out the czars!
Be careful driving in the snow! Better yet on Saturday stay home & watch the great college football games on all day long - championships!
@mccoma I thought you were pulling my leg! thanks
Laundry is finished so I am off to read my Sam Houston biography & sleep - Good night all!
@paulvalach Could be someone messing with me but it looked like a mass spammer account just opened tonight - its gone already - interesting
@buszero They will load it up with everything they can - massive new federal spending programs - waste & debt we & our kids cannot afford
I am going to try Tweetdeck first & also download Tweetie to compare them - thanks for the advice - I am still figuring out my 3Gs iPhone
Fascinating - garbage tweets are already gone! Twitter must be able to auto ID garbage spammer tweets & erased their existence! TY Twitter!
@paulvalach We are about to get snow! This is epic for Houston & dangerous driving so I will watch the great football games on Saturday
@msbeeee both very worthwhile endeavors!
@msbeeee America doesn't have much time - we MUST have a full scale conservative revolution in 2010 & take back Congress & fire Pelosi!
@sedgewick the community will crush them with crowdstrength!
@msbeeee will do - morons!
@meontwit_ter2 got it
@meontwit_ter2 will do - thank you!
@sedgewick right - of course - I was so mad I forgot for a moment - will block immediately - thanks!
@buszero Thanks bus - I stumbled a bit in my floor speech so I really appreciate seeing it was worth posting - job growth is easy=cut taxes!
How do you delete garbage tweets containing near certain virus laden hyperlinks? two idiots w new fake accounts just sent me trash tweets
@Tykerman1 Call my office in DC & let us help set up tours for you - great educational experience for a young person
