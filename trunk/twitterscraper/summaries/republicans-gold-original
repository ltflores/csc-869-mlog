@ian_x 2011-03-10 I think the challenge is more clear now. The story is still a heist, which changes how overcoming it is presented, though. Hmm.
@ian_x 2011-03-10 At least it's better to work out something like that while still outlining. heh
@ian_x 2011-03-10 This is a perfectly good outline, except the story doesn't feel like it has enough of a challenge for the protagonist. Hrmph.

@ian_x 2011-03-10 @valium_ Sorry it took so long. I kept running out of copies, and then shipping was more expensive than I guessed. All set now though!
@ian_x 2011-03-10 @valium_ @gliovampire Will you guys have a table at Bristol, or just walking around?
@ian_x 2011-03-10 @valium_ It will be 8 of Black Label Comics #1, plus 2 of the Ltd. Edition, plus 3 of The Deathlings. Is that right? :)

@JayneQPublic 2010-11-02 GOP will claim credit for electoral victories. Truth is, voters are voting against Democrats, not FOR Republicans.

@fredthompson 2011-03-14 Obama still hasn't paid Springfiled, IL $55,457 his campaign owes since 2008. Amazing. Something Obama doesn't want to spend money on. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-14 Report: Iran using "child soldiers" to suppress anti-government demonstrations. Must be bucking for a seat on UN Human Rights Council. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-12 Runaway Democrat on MSNBC: "this is our Pearl Harbor". Ok... and are unions the Japanese or the Americans in this scenario? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-12 Report: gas prices up 67% since Obama became president. Obviously it's because somebody out there isn't inflating their tires properly #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-11 PressSec Carney: WI Gov "not following the principle that we need to all come together". Hard to do w/40% of Senate hiding in IL. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-11 Dem Rep Thompson: hearings on radical Islam creates more terrorists. Kinda like saying learning to swim increases chance of drowning. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-11 ABC: Trump's run for President just a publicity stunt. Hey Donald... it doesn't work. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-11 France: diplomatic recognition to Libyan rebels. Last time France took lead while US did nothing was b/c America not discovered yet. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 Obama to fix oil prices by tapping into U.S. strategic oil reserve. Good plan. Then they can fill it back up with nice, cheap, IOU's. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 IntSec Salazar on ANWR drilling: "We don’t believe that you need to drill everywhere". Ok, then how about letting us drill SOMEWHERE? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 Only 68 high schools ask Obama to speak on grad day. Maybe b/c "you can grow up to do what I did" is now more warning than inspiration #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 Neighbors complain on MA wind turbine b/c of constant, irritating noise. Which reminds me, Obama's sending Biden to Russia this week. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 Global warming satellite crashes on take-off. Terrible. How are these guys supposed to prove global warming without data to fudge? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-08 Connecticut town forced to give union workers free coffee. My advice: give 'em Tea, instead. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-07 Charlie Sheen in weird web video: "I'm not bi-polar, I'm bi-winning". If he's doing so great, how come he's not bi-working? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-07 Michael Moore at WI protest: "America is not broke." Too bad he can't say the same thing about the last scale he stepped on. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-07 Scientist: alien life forms found on meteorites. Uh oh. He's gonna get in trouble with Eric Holder for profiling. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-02 Dem Rep Rangel: attacking collective bargaining rights "close to slavery". But forcing you to buy health insurance is freedom? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-02 Report: wasteful govt has 82 programs to improve teacher quality. Mostly on sign-making, marching, chanting & getting fake sick-notes. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-02 WI GOP leader in secret meeting w/ Runaway Dems in IL. Hopefully it was just to hand out white flags for their return home. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-02 Fmr GE CEO Welch: Obama's tack to center only "verbal, not actionable". Don't criticize. Most transparent thing in his administration. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-02 Yemen president blames US for mounting protests. Crazy talk. Unless protesters are union members, I doubt Obama would get involved. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 Planter's unveils new eco-friendly peanut-shaped NutMobile. Huh. Who would ever associate environmentalism with nuts? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 Louis Farrakhan in Chicago: America will soon face uprisings like in the Middle East. Try to keep up, Louis. It happened last November #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 Military makes tiny, hummingbird-like spy-plane. Pretty impressive. Now they just need to equip it with tiny Hellfire missiles. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 Ambassador to China "deeply concerned" over crackdowns. Worried China will be so busy crushing dissent won't have time to buy US Bonds #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 WI Gov Walker: if Dems don't come back, public worker firings begin. Well, they can always get jobs in the booming IL hotel industry. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-03-01 When I finally do get my Oscar, I promise not to go on & on in my acceptance speech like some of those fellas did http://bit.ly/ggJGIT #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-28 Study: right-wing candidates better-looking than left. Should I be concerned these results came out right after I got out of politics? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-28 Study: small nuke war would drop global temps 3 degrees. Great. Expect Obama to give aid money to Iran & call it a green jobs program. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-27 During speech in NYC, Biden requested teleprompter be removed. It's not often you see an entire audience turn green with envy. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-27 PressSec Carney: despite secret lobbyist meetings, WH showing "unprecedented levels of transparency." High or low? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-25 Runaway Dem: hiding in IL "a financial hardship". Could be worse. Could be stuck in WI paying the public union's salaries. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-25 Might snow in San Fran, 1st time in 35 years. Completely harmless natural substance, so I suppose Obama'll have the EPA regulate it. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-25 Pelosi rewrites DNC resolution honoring her. Surprised she didn't make it 2000 pages & insist it be passed at night on a weekend. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-25 Saudis promise to up oil output to keep energy prices down. What would Obama's solar-powered solution be? Promising more sunny days? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-24 During Chicago elections, 3 polling judges removed for showing up drunk. Big deal. Half the people voting for Rahm weren't even alive. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-24 Iran's President Ahmadinejad said that Mideast leaders should heed calls for change. Runaway Democrats in the Midwest should, too. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-24 Saudi King doles out $37B to head off civil unrest. To his credit, at least he's not claiming he's doing it to save or create jobs. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-23 MSNBC's Matthews compared Sarah Palin to Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. Huh. I had no idea Gaddafi had ever field-dressed a moose. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-23 Gaddafi blames "tyranny of US" for Libya riots. Right. If we had any power there, we'd make G/K/Qaddafi pick one spelling for his name #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-23 Harry Reid: "the time has come to outlaw prostitution." Typical Dem. Aiming to shut down the one industry that'll never need a bailout #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-23 WI GOP passes rule that Dems must pick up paychecks in person. Better idea: 1st one back gets to keep ALL the missing Dems' paychecks. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-23 Dems in Indiana now fleeing state to prevent budget vote. Have Republicans tried yelling "ally ally oxen free"? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-22 WI Dem hiding in IL: "we'll do this as long as necessary". Funny, that's what people in WI are saying about electing Republicans. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-22 U of WI still "gathering info" on docs giving fake sick notes to protesters. Guys, if you can't find YouTube, ask any 12-yr-old. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-22 Docs cure psych diseases w/ "brain pacemaker" implants. Should send some up to DC and see if they work on compulsive spending disorder #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-22 Left compares Obama to Reagan. Can you imagine him in 1987? "Mr. Gorbachev, please negotiate structural modifications to this wall." #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-22 Schoolkids rejecting healthy lunches b/c of lousy taste. I'd call it a perfect metaphor for failed govt programs, but this IS one. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-21 US Navy makes laser cannon to shoot down missiles. New missile defense system... wonder which country Obama will pull it out of first? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-21 Rumsfeld: Obama "made a practice of trying to apologize for US." So much he's perfected it. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-21 WI Gov Walker: budget bill prevents 12,000 workers from being fired. Union prefers if lose jobs, then lose jobs & FULL benefits. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-21 WI docs write fake excuse notes for protesting teachers. Is this some of that waste, fraud & abuse that Obamacare was supposed to fix? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-19 Dem Rep Cleaver:country needs "watchdog group" to "rank us on our civility". Congressman, in the real world, those are called "voters" #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-19 Michael Moore: Madison, Wisconsin the "new Cairo". Huh. I didn't know Iran had thrown its support behind the teachers' unions. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 Obama: Lincoln built "intercontinental railroad" during Civil War. Must've been before transcontinental railroad finished in 1869. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 PressSec Carney: goals of stimulus package "have been met". I always thought 9% unemployment was more a national tragedy than a goal. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 GOP dumps 9 Obama "Czars". Obama to fix w/ a little word-shuffle like he always does: hire 'em back & call 'em "El Presidentes". #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 House passes bill defunding Planned Parenthood. Not often enough that you have the government save money and lives at the same time. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 WI Dems leave state to avoid budget vote. Guys, that's not what "when the going gets tough, the tough get going" means. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-18 In Wisconsin, 1100 teachers called in "sick" to protest the governor's new budget. I didn't know a lack of pork could cause swine flu. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-17 FCC head: "net neutrality" policy would create jobs. Only thing these jokers DON'T think creates jobs are the things that actually DO. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-17 Canadian-born Justin Bieber: his country's single-payer HC system better. It's not THAT great. Obviously it doesn't pay for haircuts. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-17 Dems use puppets to support PBS. Typical Washington presser: lots of political advice from people with empty heads and polyester hair. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-17 TSA agents steal $160k in cash from checked bags. Guys, you're supposed to be looking for things that explode, not things that inflate #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-17 PressSec Carney on Iranian warships:"I don't have anything for you". Good answer. Won't have to backtrack/reposition/explain tommorrow #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-16 IRS hires 1000 to "encourage compliance" w/ Obamacare. Real question on Obamacare: how do we encourage compliance w/ the Constitution? #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-16 Report:food prices high b/c developed nations turning corn into ethanol. Mistake here is putting it in gas tanks instead of mason jars #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-16 1st 2 days Press Sec Carney holds no press briefing. Not surprised. Napolitano heads Homeland Security & still hasn't secured anything #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-16 CO to ban using welfare debit cards at strip club ATMs. Strip clubs to install produce aisles & call selves "adult grocery stores". #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 England: don't put wire mesh over windows lest burglars hurt selves. Yes. Install bear traps to keep them away from dangerous windows. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 DHS wants cable companies to carry anti-US propagandist Al-Jazeera network. Guess they figure it'll restore balance if NPR defunded. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 New Press Sec Carney doesn't hold 1st day presser. It's being hailed as most honest White House press briefing of this administration. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 Man jailed after filming speedometer while driving 140. Don't break law w/ camera around. That's why Obamacare debates not on C-SPAN. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 MSNBC's Matthews: "it took Obama" for Egypt to happen. Yup, every revolution needs a guy on the sidelines asking "what's going on?" #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 Climate Panel contradicts Gore: snow not b/c of global warming. Well, the important thing here is that the science is settled. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 Berkeley to invite ex-Gitmo'ers to live in city. Huh? Gitmo guys can't possibly hate military enough to fit in with that community. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-15 Biden: Iran should let people march in streets like Egypt. Oops. Obama forgot to tell Joe words like that are only for our allies. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-14 Obama outreach: inviting GOP Reps to WH functions. Probably quit soon. All they do while they're there is measure the drapes. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-14 Statue of King Tut missing in Europe. Because of ancient curse, guy who stole it will sit next to Joe Biden on a Cairo to DC flight. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-14 IN Gov Daniels: fed debt is "new red menace". Good name - the left sees damage it's done in Europe, but insists it's no threat to US. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 Biden: need to spend on high-speed trains to "seize the future." Yeah, like draining all the oil out of a car to seize the engine. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 C Lee tells woman on Craigslist he's divorced lobbyist, not married Rep. Probably 1st time anyone's lied by saying he WAS a lobbyist #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 Bill Maher: O'Reilly "unpatriotic" for interrupting Obama during interview. 3 years ago, would've called it "speaking truth to power". #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 State Dept to start Tweeting in Arabic. Please tell me this isn't being handled by the same guy who did the Russian "reset" button. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 GOP Rep to EPA head: "do you believe in law of supply & demand?" You'd think more liberals would, b/c it's not written in Constitution #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-13 iPhone releases app to help Catholics confess sins. All I can say is, if you use it, make sure you're signed out of Twitter, first. #tcot
@fredthompson 2011-02-11 Napolitano: terror threat at "most heightened state" since 9/11. Wish we could say the same about our confidence in DHS. #tcot
