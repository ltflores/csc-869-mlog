@barackobama 2011-01-25 Tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 Instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 This is our generation’s Sputnik moment. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 What we can do—what America does better than anyone—is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That’s how our people will prosper. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place to do business. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can’t just stand still. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 The world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known...the economy is growing again. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 We will move forward together, or not at all—for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. #SOTU
@barackobama 2011-01-25 About to address the nation on the state of our union. Watch at http://wh.gov/live and follow live tweets here from Organizing for America.

@heathercorinna 2011-03-12 @sexpositiveblog The vast majority of users are under 25.  I'd say 85% at a minimum. Alexa reflects that, too.

@tedlieu 2011-03-10 As a US Citizen and a veteran, I am ashamed our Congress is holding hearings targeting Americans based on their religion.
@tedlieu 2011-03-08 Based on #census data, my Senate District 28 will need to expand by over 50,000 people in the next redistricting!

@tedlieu 2011-03-03 Honored to speak at ILWU Local 13 meeting. ILWU is a cornerstone of S. Cal. economy. Very excited to be proud wearer of new ILWU jacket.
@tedlieu 2011-03-03 @CapitolAlert Deeply concerned Crane perpetuates myth that collective bargaining caused state econ crisis. It was Wall St, not teachers.
@tedlieu 2011-03-03 @DavidOAtkins @ThePlumLineGS The public understands our recession was not caused by unions, but by overreaching by Wall Street.
@tedlieu 2011-03-03 Honored to be appointed to the CA Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as Veterans, Insurance, and Elections Committees!
@tedlieu 2011-03-02 @LATPoliticsCA I hope all candidates for Harman's seat commit to keeping LA Air Force Base, and its jobs, in Congressional District 36.
@tedlieu 2011-03-02 @katiemerrill Collective Bargaining did not cause crisis. It was Collateralized Debt Obligations that brought American economy to its knees.
@tedlieu 2011-03-02 Note to Westboro Church: The ultimate protector of the First Amendment is the US military and those that gave their lives for our country.
@tedlieu 2011-03-02 @heysanjay If you are in town, come to my Swearing In Ceremony this Saturday at 3 pm at CSU Dominguez Hills.  RSVP to 310 328 1028.
@tedlieu 2011-03-02 I hope my Swearing In location can be expanded b/c RSVPs have skyrocketed. Feel free to compound this problem by RSVPing to www.TedLieu.com.
@tedlieu 2011-03-01 @CapitolAlert Note to Mr. Crane: collective bargaining did not cause economic crisis. Lack of healthy tension on Wall Street caused crisis.
@tedlieu 2011-02-28 Best wishes to my friend Jane Harman, who retired. She is significant reason LA Air Force Base remains in CD36, generating 65,000 good jobs.
@tedlieu 2011-02-27 My son asked me if Lara Croft Tomb Raider was going to win an Oscar.  I don't want to burst his bubble.

@tedlieu 2011-02-26 Watching my seven-year old and his team play basketball.  Well, no one is LeBron James, but at least they show gratitude and have class.
@tedlieu 2011-02-26 @KeithPR Boba milk tea.
@tedlieu 2011-02-26 @FlashReport We can make cuts without eliminating collective bargaining. Labor is one of the few institutions that represents middle class.
@tedlieu 2011-02-26 Honored to speak at S. County Labor Breakfast.  Not only did workers not cause this economic crisis, they are a vital part of the solution.
@tedlieu 2011-02-25 At goodbye celebration for Jane Harman. America is safer because of her service. Look forward to her service on world stage at Wilson Ctr.

@tedlieu 2011-02-24 Honored to be appointed CA Senate Chair of Labor and Industrial Relations during this seminal time in our nation's & state's history.
@tedlieu 2011-02-24 Senate Bill 2x just passed State Senate!  Will mandate renewable energy of 33% by 2020.  Bipartisan vote!
@tedlieu 2011-02-24 Kudos to Experian for adding rental payment histories to credit reports. This will help non-homeowners build up their credit score.
@tedlieu 2011-02-23 Tomorrow I will vote YES on SB 2X, which increases renewable energy in CA.  It mandates 33% renewables by 2020. Clean energy is our future.
@tedlieu 2011-02-23 @CNReporter More than happy to discuss my bills with any interested parties. Testify in hearing or send my office information. 916 651 4028.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @Dems4Peace happy to discuss my bill SB 661. Democracy works best when all sides are heard and I welcome comments and suggestions.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @WalterViceChair Bring on the recall!  Let's see if the voters agree with me that people shouldn't bring guns into school classrooms.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @jlbourne Constitution does not say you have right to open carry firearms onto planes.  Nor do you have right to open carry guns to school.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @BayArea_OC open carry folks want to repeal the law prohibiting guns in schools. I want to further strengthen the law by closing loopholes.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @BayArea_OC my school gun control bill will be set for hearing in Sacramento soon. I look forward to hearing from folks who want to testify.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 My prayers go to the families of my constituents, Jean and Scott Adam of Marina Del Rey, who were killed by Somali pirates today.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @Schwarzenegger LeBron James has a lot of making up to do for the arrogant, ungrateful, and unprofessional manner in how he left Cleveland.
@tedlieu 2011-02-22 @BayArea_OC my bill shuts down the loophole where anyone can bring a gun to a school classroom if it is in a locked container. Read my bill.
@tedlieu 2011-02-21 @BayArea_OC open carry folks are attacking my bill, SB 661, which expands school gun control laws. Support my bill by sending me a tweet.
@tedlieu 2011-02-21 @BayArea_OC I was responding to open carry folks in south bay who wanted to repeal the school gun control laws. My bill expands the law.
@tedlieu 2011-02-21 @BayArea_OC next time read my bill. It both expands gun free school zone to 1500 ft AND makes it more difficult to bring guns into school.
@tedlieu 2011-02-20 @southbayoc the law in California is that you cannot bring guns to school.  Apparently some extremists believe that law should be repealed.
@tedlieu 2011-02-19 Finished reading Taleb's book Black Swan (nothing to do with the movie).  Amazing book.  It has altered my thinking.
@tedlieu 2011-02-18 Let's be clear: workers on fixed salaries did not cause this economic crisis. Our recession was caused by those paid indefensible bonuses.
@tedlieu 2011-02-18 Humbled to be sworn in as State Senator for the 28th Senate District.  Thank you to all my supporters, constituents, and family.
@tedlieu 2011-02-16 @steve4jerry my son said he could spare one penny.  He's frugal.
@tedlieu 2011-02-16 My five-year old found two pennies.  He said he will buy ice cream at the store with them.  He will shortly learn he needs more pennies.
@tedlieu 2011-02-16 Thanks again to all the volunteers, supporters, & voters for electing me to the State Senate. Special thanks to my wife who lets me do this.

@tedlieu 2011-01-31 @jasonkinney Brown not only sounds post-partisan, he is actually interested in engaging stakeholders. Refreshing difference.
@tedlieu 2011-01-31 Correction to my previous post, apparently NBC cut away from programming and to Brown speech right before he spoke.
@tedlieu 2011-01-31 @iyamiyam that's odd because neither the local news nor the menu guide showed the speech. I wonder if NBC showed cut into the speech late?

@JuliaBrownley 2009-06-03 Scarcely any of the 60,000 tons of PVC generated annually in CA is recycled because of high costs and few markets for it.

@raygun01 2011-03-11 Desire to get a new phone rises significantly once I find myself at an event like SXSW. The Droid is old, slow and battery inefficient.

@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Best Japan headline of the morning: "Hell and High Water"
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @probert06 No, I was channeling the way others responded to my daughters curly hair vs. her straight hair.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @FrenchieGlobal That is a very real thing.  I once considered writing a column about how hair/lack of swimming was drowning hazard.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @probert06 My fondness?
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @PinkPeonies Great line in that film: women says (paraphrasing) "how is it revolutionary to wear my hair the way it grows out of my head?"
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 But, with her natural curly hair my daughter is free to play and swim and run in the rain.  Must have been terribly oppression not to.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 There is something deeply emotional (something I don't understand) about long, straight hair – If you can do it, it's almost a sin not to.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 The hair thing is deeply cultural...my daughter used to wear her hair straight.  When she started fencing, she stopped. Relatives freaked.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @DanFriedman81 True.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @DanFriedman81 People who grow fruits and vegetables are farmers too.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @tuleesha No.  Grammar rules rule!
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Lastly (and this is a touchy one) hairstyles contribute to female obesity - refusal to sweat out an expensive do with exercise.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @drschroe If you want sugary drinks to cost more, stop subsidizing crops that make high fructose corn syrup cheap.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @KBDPHD I would much rather see gov redirect subsidies to make healthy options cheaper.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Dangerous neighborhoods also make kids fat: parents keep them inside to keep them safe; they get less exercise from running around outside.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @jmittell So true.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @epaulnet Maybe, but at least direct more subsidies to farmers who grow fruit and veggies.  Now there are almost none.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @amhill That could be the result of palette training - research has shown that high-fat, high-calorie diets are as addictive as heroin
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 And, gym membership are expensive and gyms generally aren't located in poor neighborhoods anyway.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Also, I hate how people chalk up obesity completely to poor choices. Many poor people simply find the cheapest source of the most calories.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 ...compare to only 4% of school with 21-49 percent minority in enrollment who had no recess for 1st graders.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 And the result have been worst for minority kids: 14% of school w/ 50+ percent minorities had no recess for 1st graders...
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Also, No Child Left Behind may be contributing to childhood obesity:  since passed, 20% of school districts have cut recess by 50 mins/week.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @hillarykwiatek True.
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 @MagentaRocks government
@CharlesMBlow 2011-03-12 Hate that I didn't have space to discuss gov culpability in making us fat: misdirecting subsidies so that Twinkies cost less than carrots.

@aegies 2011-03-12 @dotmoe i've had serious playback issues in other formats with lower bitrates. you might try remuxing a couple of files with m2ts.
@aegies 2011-03-12 @dotmoe unknown. maybe not on 360? the wireless cards are limited by the 360's USB bandwidth caps.
@aegies 2011-03-12 and for everyone else, that last tweet was a wall of gibberish. sorry!
@aegies 2011-03-12 for the av nerds out there: the 360 and ps3 can play back 1080p 5.1 files without issue in the .m2ts format. m2ts supports avchd and vc-1.

@aegies 2011-03-10 Xbox 360 sold 535k for the month of February. Highest non holiday month ever. That's more 360s than the month Halo 3 released.
@aegies 2011-03-10 @Morielia eh.
@aegies 2011-03-10 @Mike_landis wait, what?
@aegies 2011-03-10 you should. tis cool. RT @sp8des: come check out  The Darkness II at PAX East at Booth #950 for a worldwide exclusive first hands-on!
@aegies 2011-03-09 This isn't the game in question, but I thought Bulletstorm's score was quite good, as an example.
@aegies 2011-03-09 I'm not sure what it says when I'm shocked that a shooter has a fantastic soundtrack.
@aegies 2011-03-09 welp, looks like i'm finally buying a ps+ membership at some point.
@aegies 2011-03-08 @betajames as someone who has dated outside of my ethnicity more often than not, i can say the comment about "no one noticing" is bullshit.
@aegies 2011-03-08 @Rydog atrix?
@aegies 2011-03-08 Too much going on for shitty hotel internet.
@aegies 2011-03-08 @MRSallee those things are kind of mutually exclusive, at least with lcds.
@aegies 2011-03-08 @MRSallee that depends on what's most important to you. For me, it was input lag/control latency for games.
@aegies 2011-03-08 shadows of the damned preview written. now it's time to sleep on it and edit a bit more tomorrow morning.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @snakpakk success!
@aegies 2011-03-07 @snakpakk "just go with the usual stuff maybe. dark and ominous. like losing your penis is a bad thing."
@aegies 2011-03-07 forgetting sarah marshall is much more sharply written than it's given credit for.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @sanzeebury i did. i wrote a preview about it a couple of weeks ago on @ign. they're good!
@aegies 2011-03-07 @sterling_m i look forward to stories of her wrecking fools come april with the beta.
@aegies 2011-03-07 found out last week while checking out the darkness II that @sp8des is way harder core about gears than you. and probably me.
@aegies 2011-03-07 hey weather, if you could not rain right when i'm getting ready to run, that would be totally tits.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @fiddlecub i think streamlining in the interest of letting me get to the good parts is fine. too many games cling to genre conventions.
@aegies 2011-03-07 i hate feeling like a publisher is trying to pull a fast one on me.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @SamitSarkar this doesn't have anything to do with shadows
@aegies 2011-03-07 i don't think i've ever explained so much about tessellation in  my life.
@aegies 2011-03-07 this shadows of the damned preview needs appropriate music.... alright. Broken it is.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @sanzeebury ie9 and chrome are much faster in every application i've tried.
@aegies 2011-03-07 will firefox 4 not be a slow, bloated, memory leaking piece of crap? cause that would be nice.
@aegies 2011-03-07 @chespace Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea was the last PJ Harvey record I truly loved.
@aegies 2011-03-06 @k4el that would be a relief!
@aegies 2011-03-06 @jason_wilson because i've paid for it once? and even with that, the user experience is vastly superior.

@aegies 2011-03-06 @sterling_m @MitchyD yeah. i also just dropped about 700 bucks to upgrade my computer to current tech levels. fucking technology.
@aegies 2011-03-06 @sterling_m nope. 2009 40GB. so i'm not clinging to backwards compatibility.
@aegies 2011-03-06 @sterling_m i'm on 360 number 11.
@aegies 2011-03-06 @sterling_m can i not just pop it from one system to another?
@aegies 2011-03-06 @sterling_m honestly, there's so little i keep on it that i wouldn't be crushed if something did happen.
@aegies 2011-03-06 so multiple people are tweeting that my ps3 is knocking on the YLOD door. i find this surprising, given how often i use this thing.

@acedtect 2011-03-03 George R. R. Martin's "A Dance With Dragons" July 12! http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2011/03/dance-with-dragons-will-be-released-in.html
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @dantz I should have added "to me" you're right.
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @Aeltaarion The electrical system has the same issue and yet we almost never have to 'throttle' high users. Rolling brownouts maybe...
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @Aeltaarion The issue is more complex than I implied but there is a false premise.  Everyone will not be downloading at full potential.
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @JohnAnealio Thanks for making robot songs!
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @julianrdetris Yep that was me, with @joshlawrence next to me. @Veronica is in that same show.
@acedtect 2011-03-03 @dantz can't we both be right?  Perfect for you, useless for me.  We're just different.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @dbrodbeck what a coincidence. So did I.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @mattwarren Thanks man!  A little daunting to think about the show in a full-on "screening room" lol
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @TSSaloic Sadly it is not.  21+ It's a bar.  But we'll be out and about with the liveview in all-ages land.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 Free robot songs! http://johnanealio.bandcamp.com/album/the-robot-e-p
@acedtect 2011-03-02 Just got an "early access code" for Duke Nukem Forever.  Mostly downloadable wallpaper, but some concept art and the promise of a demo
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @gregharbin I didnt read it, it was my fear.  And as I said, they may not be allowed to do it, but if they do, I was guessing who would.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @sarahlane check the drawer.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @HateBadDesign Astrid.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 Nintendo 3DS gets Netflix.  A tablet gets a ship date, BlackBerry Playbook coming in April, oh yeah and iPad 2 http://live.twit.tv/
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @SergioB_ Good question... but the Kindle one has hinges right?  And no magnets.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @Redestium Yeah with @raygun01 and @eileentv They've been beta-testing it on Mondays
@acedtect 2011-03-02 Very excited about Apple's new announcement of a $70 square of leather.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 RT @twitlive: Live Apple coverage today at 9:30a PST with @acedtect, @Ihnatko, @AlexLindsay, @SarahLane, @MostlyLisa & @LeoLaporte  http ...
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @OMGEddieFTW true. But I've never had a problem with it before.  I always try it because I feel it's what most people will have around.
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @pablolin I know.  I should listen to you and @Rafe
@acedtect 2011-03-02 @Fireforce Morning
@acedtect 2011-03-02 MBP data transfer from Time Machine went smooth, but it's the first time an ethernet transfer wouldn't work.  Most won't have time machine.
@acedtect 2011-03-01 @kevinchen I would if the new MBP ever stops canceling the migration.
@acedtect 2011-03-01 RT @clindhartsen: @acedtect @extralife Hat? http://bbliveshow.info/File:TomsHats.gif
@acedtect 2011-03-01 Data migration to my new MBP is a spectacular failure.  Glitchy ethernet transfer, error saying new MBP has an 'out of date OS' and more
@acedtect 2011-03-01 If Baidu is a pirate, isn't Google? Can "App Store" be trademarked? Microsoft Windows 8 tablet coming by June? http://live.twit.tv/
@acedtect 2011-03-01 @ginatrapani @bodger shucks, thanks gina!  however now that you've revealed my secret you must be forever silenced. Minions - seize her!
