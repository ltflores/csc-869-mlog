@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 GOP is trying to cut Obama health care, Medicare and Medicaid... When people say, "Republicans make me sick" they aren't lying!
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 Irony: GOP thinks medical term for woman's reproductive organs is vulgar, yet this year, they thought they were experts on rape definition.
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 Sarah Palin's family exemplifies 2 things: Abstinence-only education does NOT work, and the wealthy can continue to preach in support of it.
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 want to reduce the numbers of abortion? offer sex ed and access to contraception. Those against abortion are against these things as well.
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 Dear GOP, When you limit access to abortion, you don't make it more rare, you make it more dangerous for women.
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 In 2011 GOP tried to: redefine rape to limit abortion access, rid abortion 4 incest, allow murder of abortion docs as "justifiable homicide"
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 The woman next to me at step aerobics class kept sneezing without covering her nose. So I didn't feel bad about farting w/o covering my ass.

@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 My sister's life-saving medications cost $100,000 a year.  She's permanently disabled. Without Medicare, Mr. @ericcantor, she dies!
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 dear @ericcantor, you are too extreme, especially for a @gopleader. You're creating a "death panel" by denying Medicare to sick poor people.
@DCdebbie 2011-04-11 Dear @ericcantor, you say Medicare recipients don't need it as a "safety net." you are wrong. My sister would die w/o her meds. @gopleader

@aegies 2011-04-09 @agentbizzle "The Day the Earth Ran Out of Ideas."
@aegies 2011-04-09 @agentbizzle i believe that's in the general vicinity of the "triforce ferris wheel."
@aegies 2011-04-09 @agentbizzle so it's a step up from sisqo with a jager problem then?
@aegies 2011-04-09 @TheMoronMike i'm also very curious.
@aegies 2011-04-09 was going to write a preview of Sanctum, but captivate got in the way. now i have the full version in my steam account. review it is!
@aegies 2011-04-09 this could be a big deal. RT @IGN: Are free-to-play games coming to Xbox Live next year? http://go.ign.com/hvkO4f
@aegies 2011-04-09 "promise" is a scary word in all of its forms.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @MRSallee and i would get to hear you swear!
@aegies 2011-04-09 @Karaya_One and i could not disagree more with that statement. acceptance of differences is part of community.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @Karaya_One it didn't actually. that coincided with the concerted push to dismantle the welfare state in the late 70s-80s.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @Karaya_One and i would contend that banding together, providing for each other, helping, is the crux of civilization.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @PwamCider listen to @MRSallee. he's right.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @MRSallee indeed. so, when are you going to fix those fucking potholes? also, could you stop tearing up second during the week?
@aegies 2011-04-09 @MRSallee i didn't realize you paved all those roads yourself!
@aegies 2011-04-09 @notaxation i think they're betting on general ignorance as to how much the federal budget is and what it goes to, which isn't a bad bet.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @notaxation right, and the fighter in me wants to say "it's red meat for their base, so they can get what they want." which it is, but.
@aegies 2011-04-09 @XaiaX it's totally true. but it's spoiled bullshit to crucify the people whose job it is to make things work for settling for good.

@acedtect 2011-04-04 I like the term "Spitter" for spam on Twitter.
@acedtect 2011-04-04 @extralife I know that girl.  She wouldn't speak to me in high school, and now she's all like, "First hour free! Only 9.99 an hour after!"
@acedtect 2011-04-04 @shwood that hilarious typo is worthy of being written by me. "I've got your crap, you'll pay the ransom if you want it back!"
@acedtect 2011-04-04 It may be just my lucky week, but I'm noticing a lot more spammy at replies on Twitter lately.
